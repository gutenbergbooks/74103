<h2>NEW EAGLE SERIES</h2>

<p class="center"><b>ISSUED WEEKLY</b></p>


<p>The books in this line comprise an unrivaled collection of copyrighted
novels by authors who have won fame wherever the
English language is spoken. Foremost among these is Mrs.
Georgie Sheldon, whose works are contained in this line exclusively.
Every book in the New Eagle Series is of generous length, of
attractive appearance, and of undoubted merit. No better literature
can be had at any price. Beware of imitations of the S. &amp; S. novels,
which are sold cheap because their publishers were put to no expense
in the matter of purchasing manuscripts and making plates.</p>


<p class="center">ALL TITLES ALWAYS IN PRINT</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>TO THE PUBLIC:—These books are sold by news dealers everywhere.
If your dealer does not keep them, and will not get them for
you, send direct to the publishers, in which case four cents must be
added to the price per copy to cover postage.</p>

<p>In order that there may be no confusion, we desire to say that
the books listed above will be issued, during the respective
months, in New York City and vicinity. They may not reach
the readers, at a distance, promptly, on account of delays in
transportation.</p>

<p>While the books in the New Eagle Series are undoubtedly better
value, being bigger books, the stories offered to the public in this
line must not be underestimated. There are over four hundred
copyrighted books by famous authors, which cannot be had in
any other line. No other publisher in the world has a line that
contains so many different titles, nor can any publisher ever hope
to secure books that will match those in the Eagle Series in quality.</p>

<p>This is the pioneer line of copyrighted novels, and that it has
struck popular fancy just right is proven by the fact that for fifteen
years it has been the first choice of American readers. The only
reason that we can afford to give such excellent reading at such a
low price is that our unlimited capital and great organization enable
us to manufacture books more cheaply and to sell more of
them without expensive advertising, than any other publishers.</p>


<p class="center">ALL TITLES ALWAYS IN PRINT</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>TO THE PUBLIC:—These books are sold by news dealers everywhere.
If your dealer does not keep them, and will not get them for
you, send direct to the publishers, in which case four cents must be
added to the price per copy to cover postage.</p>

<p class="center">BEHIND THE FOOTLIGHTS.</p>


<p>“Good-night! Good-night! Parting is such sweet
sorrow that I shall say good-night till it be morrow!”</p>

<p>The speaker was a young girl, who stood in the middle
of the room, her hands clasped, her head bent forward,
her eyes fixed in a dreamy rapture, and the remark was
addressed to—no one.</p>

<p>She paused, sighed a little—not from impatience, but
with a wistful dissatisfaction—and absently moved to the
window, through which the last rays of the June sun
were flickering redly.</p>

<p>She stood there for a moment or two, then began to
pace the room with a lithe, undulating grace. It was a
pity that she was alone, because such beauty and grace
were wasted on the desert air of the rather grim and
dingy room. It was a pity that Sir John Everett Millais,
or Mr. Edwin Long, or some other of the great portrait
painters were not present to transfer her beauty of face
and form, for it was a loveliness of no common order.</p>

<p>Many a poet’s pen had attempted to describe Doris
Marlowe, but it may safely be said that not one had succeeded;
and not even a great portrait painter could have
depicted the mobility of her clear, oval face, and its dark
eyes and sensitive lips—eyes and lips so full of expression
that people were sometimes almost convinced that she had
spoken before she had uttered a word.</p>

<p>This evening, and at this moment, her face was all
alive, as it were, with expression, as she put up her hand
to smooth back the thick tresses of dark brown hair—so
dark that it was almost black—and, stopping suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
before a pier glass which stood at the end of the room,
repeated the familiar lines:</p>

<p>“Good-night! Good-night! Parting is such sweet sorrow
that I shall say good-night till it be morrow!”</p>

<p>“Ah, no! No, no, no!” she exclaimed, stamping her
foot and drawing her brows together at the reflection in
the glass. “That is not it, nor anything like it. I shall
never get it! Never! Nev——”</p>

<p>The door opened behind her, and she turned her wistful,
dissatisfied, restless face over her shoulder toward
the comer. It was an old man, bent almost double, with
a thin and haggard face, from which gleamed a pair of
dark eyes so brilliant and peering that they made the rest
of the face look almost lifeless. He looked at her keenly,
as he paused as if for breath, and, still looking at her,
went to the table and laid a long roll of paper upon it;
then he sank into a chair, and, leaning on his stick, said,
in a hollow voice:</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t well, Jeffrey. It’s bad, as bad as could
be!” and the mobile lips allowed a quick, impatient laugh
to escape, then compressed themselves as if annoyed at
their levity. “I cannot do it! I cannot! I have tried it
a hundred times, a thousand times! And it sounds more
like—oh, it sounds more like a servant-maid saying,
‘Good-night, good-night, call me at seven to-morrow!’
than Juliet’s immortal adieu!”</p>

<p>“Does it?” said the old man, calmly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it does; very much!” she retorted, half laughing
again. “Oh, Jeffrey, I can’t do it, and that is the simple
truth! Tell them I cannot do it, and—and beg me off.”</p>

<p>The old man stretched out his hand slowly, and taking
the paper from the table, as slowly unfastened it and
displayed it at full length.</p>

<p>It was a playbill, printed in the usual style, in red and
blue ink—</p>

<p class="center">
Theatre Royal, Barton.<br>
“Romeo and Juliet.”<br>
Miss Doris Marlowe as Juliet.<br>
</p>

<p>The girl looked at it, a faint color coming into her
face; then she raised her eyes to the glittering ones above
the placard and shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Doris Marlowe will murder Juliet!” she said;
“that is what it will be, Jeffrey—simple murder. You
must prevent the perpetration of so hideous a crime!”</p>

<p>“Too late!” he said in his hollow voice; “the bills are
already out. The play is advertised in the papers; they
were booking at the theatre when I left. You must play
it. What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“The matter——” she began, then stopped abruptly, as
if in despair. “I don’t know what is the matter. I only
feel as if—oh, as if I were any one but Juliet. Why didn’t
you let me go on playing little comedy parts, Jeffrey? I
could do those after a fashion—but Juliet! I ought to
be flattered,” and she looked at the bill, “but I am very
frightened!” and she laughed again.</p>

<p>“Frightened!” he said, his thick white brows coming
together. “Why should you be frightened? Have I not
told you you could do it, and do I not know? Am I ever
wrong?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she hastened to reply. “You are always
right, and it is I who am always wrong. And indeed,
Jeffrey, dear, I will try! I will try for your sake!” and
she glided across to his chair and laid her hand—a long,
white hand, soft and slim as a child’s—upon his shoulder
with tender docility.</p>

<p>“Try for your own,” he said, not unkindly, but gravely.
“Try for art’s sake, and yet—yes, try for mine! You
know how I have set my dream on your success—you
know that it is the dream, the aim of my life! Ever
since you were a child and sat upon my knee looking up
into my face with your great eyes, I have looked forward
to the day when the world should acknowledge that Jeffrey
Flint could make a great actor though he failed himself!”</p>

<p>The dark eyes glittered still more keenly as he spoke,
and the hand that held the playbill tightened.</p>

<p>“You will succeed if you set your heart on it,” he said
more calmly. “You have done well up to now; I haven’t
praised you: that is not my way; but—but—I am satisfied.
Up to now you have got on in regular strides—to-morrow
night is the great leap! The great chance that
seldom comes more than once in a life. Take it, Doris,
take it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Jeffrey,” she said, softly; but he heard the sigh
she tried to stifle and looked up.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said grimly. “You would say——”</p>

<p>She moved away from him and leaned against the table,
her hands clasped loosely.</p>

<p>“I was going to say that it seems to me as if all the
trying in the world would not make me a Shakespeare’s
Juliet! The lines are beautiful, and I know them—oh,
yes, I know them, but——” she paused, then went on
dreamily: “Do you think any young girl, any one so
young as I am, could play it properly, Jeffrey?”</p>

<p>“Juliet was fourteen,” he said, grimly.</p>

<p>Doris smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s a mistake, I think, Jeffrey; she was eighteen,
most people say! Oh, she was young enough; yes, but—but
then you see she had met Romeo.”</p>

<p>The old man looked at her attentively, then his keen
gaze dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>“Is it necessary for an actor to have actually died before
he can perfectly represent a death scene?” he asked.</p>

<p>She laughed, and a faint blush rose to her face.</p>

<p>“Perhaps dying isn’t so important as falling in love,
Jeffrey; but it seems to me that one must have loved—and
lost—before one can play Juliet, and I’ve done
neither.”</p>

<p>He made no response to this piece of speculation; but
after some minutes’ silence he said:</p>

<p>“Do some of it, Doris.”</p>

<p>She started slightly, as if he had awakened her from
a dream, and recited some of the lines.</p>

<p>The old man watched her, and listened anxiously at
first, then with rapt attention, as, losing herself in the
part, she grew more emphatic and spontaneous; but suddenly
she stopped.</p>

<p>“It will not do, Jeffrey, will it?” she said, quickly.
“There—there is no heart in it, is there? Don’t tell me
it’s all right!” she pleaded. “I always like the truth from
you—at least!”</p>

<p>“And you get it,” he said, grimly. “No, it is not all
right. You look——” he stopped—“and your voice is
musical and thrilling, but—there is something wanting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
yet. Do not give it up—it will all come right. To-morrow
with the lights and the people—there will be a
full house, crammed—the feeling you want will come, and
I shall be satisfied.”</p>

<p>He rose and rolled up the paper.</p>

<p>“I have to go back to the theatre.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come with you,” she said, quickly.</p>

<p>“No,” he said; “you are better alone. Take your book
and go out into the fields. This room is not large
enough—” and he passed out.</p>

<p>She understood him and, after a moment or two of
reflection, got her hat, murmuring as she ran down the
stairs—</p>

<p>“Dear old Jeffrey, I must do it for his sake.”</p>

<p>Doris Marlowe, as she passed down the quiet street,
was as unlike the popular idea of an actress as it is
possible to imagine. It is too generally supposed by the
great public that an actress must necessarily be “loud” in
word, dress and voice, that she must be affected on and
off the stage, and that her behavior is as objectionable
as her manner and attire. If the usual run of actresses
are of this fashion, Doris was a singular exception to
this rule. Her voice was soft and low, and as refined
in its tones as the daughter of an earl; her manner was
as quiet as any well-bred lady’s could be, and in her plain
white dress and straw hat she looked as much like a
schoolgirl as anything else, especially as she had a copy
of “Romeo and Juliet” in her hand, which might have
been mistaken for a French grammar.</p>

<p>There was in fact nothing “loud” about her; indeed,
when off the stage she was rather silent and shy, and
the color was as apt to come into her pale white cheeks
as into those of the schoolgirl she resembled. It was
only from the quiet play of the dark thick brows, and
the ever changing expression of the eloquent eyes, that
the keenest observer would ever have detected that Doris
Marlowe was something different from the ordinary
young lady whom one meets—and forgets—every day.</p>

<p>She passed up the street, her book held lightly in her
hand, her eyes fixed dreamily on the roseate sky, and
watching the din and bustle of the big manufacturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
town which climbed up the hill in front of her, turned
aside, and, making her way up a leafy lane, reached the
fields which are as green as if Barton and its score of
factory chimneys were a hundred miles away.</p>

<p>There was not only green grass, but clumps of trees
and a running brook, and Doris, casting herself, after the
fashion of her sex, on the bank by the stream, opened
the book and began to study.</p>

<p>But after a few minutes, during which she kept her
eyes upon the page with knitted brows, her thoughts began
to wander, and, letting the book slip to the ground,
she leaned against the trunk of a tree, and, clasping
her hands around her knees, gave herself up to maiden
meditation, fancy-free.</p>

<p>And it was of herself—of all people in the world!—she
was thinking. She was looking back, recalling her
past life, and marveling over it with a pleasant little
wonder.</p>

<p>And yet there was nothing very marvelous in it after
all.</p>

<p>Ever since she could remember she and Jeffrey—“dear
old Jeffrey!”—had been alone. Ever since she could remember
he had seemed to her as bent and white-haired
and old as he was now, and she knew no more of him, or
how it happened that he had stood to her in place of
mother and father, and kith and kin, than she knew now.</p>

<p>Of her real father and her mother she had always been
totally ignorant. As a child she had accepted Jeffrey as
a fact, without questioning, and when, in later years, she
had put some questions about her parents to him, she
had equally accepted the answer.</p>

<p>“Ask me nothing, Doris. Your mother was an angel;
your father——” Then he had stopped and left her;
and, from that day to this, Doris had not repeated the
question.</p>

<p>They had lived, she remembered, in complete solitude.
Of Jeffrey’s early life she knew nothing for certain, excepting
that he had been an actor; that he had been—and
was—a gentleman; and that he had received a good education.</p>

<p>She had no other tutor than he, and she could have
had no better. With a skill and patience which sprang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
from his love for her, he had taught her as few girls are
taught. As a child, she would speak and write with wonderful
fluency, and at the age most girls are struggling
with five-finger exercises, she could play a sonata of
Beethoven’s with a touch and brilliance which a professional
might have envied.</p>

<p>Her strange guardian’s patience was untiring. He
ransacked the stores of his memory on her behalf, he
spent hours explaining the inner meaning of some line
from Shakespeare—in showing her how to render a difficult
piece of music.</p>

<p>And when, one day, when her beautiful girlhood was
rich with the promise of a still more beautiful womanhood,
she had looked up at him laughingly, and said:</p>

<p>“Why do you take all this trouble with me, Jeffrey?
What shall I do with all these things you have taught
me?” he had startled her by turning to her with flashing
eyes, and saying, with grim earnestness:</p>

<p>“I have taken all this trouble, as you call it, for this
reason—because I love you, and because I mean you to be
a great actress!”</p>

<p>She accepted his dictum without a word, or a thought
of questioning it. She knew, then, why he had taught
her to love the great poet—why he had made her, and
still made her, recite whole plays of Shakespeare—why
he spent hours in showing her how such and such a
speech should be delivered. And she was grateful—as
grateful as if he had been rich and surrounded her
with luxury, instead of being poor and sharing with her
the shabby rooms and simple fare which were the best
he could afford.</p>

<p>It was a gray and sober life, enlivened only by frequent
visits to the theatre. They had lived in France and
Germany as well as in England, and he had taken her
to see the first players in each country.</p>

<p>“Remember,” he would say, when they had returned
from seeing some famous actress, “remember how she
spoke that line, that is how it should be delivered,” or,
“Did you notice how Madame So-and-so went off in the
second scene? Then don’t go and do likewise!” and
Doris’s trained intellect had stored up the hints for future
use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>It was a life of hard work, and some girls would have
become dull and listless, but Doris was light-hearted;
her laugh was always ringing in the dingy lodgings as if
they were palaces and she was happy and content.</p>

<p>Then had come the time of her first appearance on the
stage. It is the fashion nowadays for an actor to begin
at the top of the ladder—and, alas, how often he works
downward! Jeffrey chose that the beautiful girl whom
he had trained so carefully should begin at the bottom.</p>

<p>“Learn to walk the stage, and deliver a simple message:
that is difficult enough at first, easy as it seems,”
he had said; and Doris put on cotton frocks and white
caps, and played servant maids for a time. From them
she rose to young lady parts—always easy, unpretentious
ones, and always in the country theatres.</p>

<p>“When we take London it shall be by storm,” he said.</p>

<p>And so she went from one country town to another,
and the young actress grew more familiar with her art
each month, and the critics began to notice her, and to
praise not only her beauty but her talent.</p>

<p>And all this time, Doris, even in the gayest surroundings
of her daily life, remained unsophisticated and natural.
Jeffrey watched over her as jealously as a father
could have done.</p>

<p>He could not prevent people admiring her, but he kept
the love letter, the neat little cases of jewelry from her,
and Doris—Doris Marlowe the actress—was as ignorant
and unconscious of the wickedness of the world as the
daughter of a country rector.</p>

<p>And as ignorant and innocent of love, save the love she
had for the strange, grim being who had lavished so
much on her.</p>

<p>She had read of love in books, had acted it on the
stage, but it was as one who speaks a language he does
not understand, and who marvels at the effect his words
have upon his initiated hearers.</p>

<p>Once a young actor, who had played lovers’ parts with
her during a season, had managed to speak with her
alone—it was during the “wait” between acts—and in
faltering accents had tried to tell her that he had dared
to fall in love with the beautiful being so jealously
guarded by the dragon. Doris had listened for a moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
or two, with her lovely eyes wide open, with
puzzled astonishment, then she said:</p>

<p>“Oh, please, don’t go on! I thought it was a part of
the play,” and a smile flashed over her face.</p>

<p>The young fellow grew black, and as he passed her to
go on the stage, muttered, “Heartless!”</p>

<p>But Doris was not heartless. She had smiled because
her heart lay too deep for him to touch, because, like
the Sleeping Beauty, it was waiting for the coming prince
who should wake it into life and love, and the young
actor was not that prince.</p>

<p>Doris sat thinking of the past, quite lost, until the
striking of a church clock recalled her to the fact that a
certain young lady was to play Juliet to-morrow, and
that the aforesaid young lady had come out into the field
to study it!</p>

<p>She took up the book with a sigh.</p>

<p>“I wish I could see some one play it,” she thought;
and then there flashed into her mind the memory of one
night Jeffrey had taken her to Drury Lane to see a famous
actress in the part; but they did not see her after
all, for during the first act there had been one of those
slight but unmistakable movements in the audience which
announces the entrance of some one of importance.</p>

<p>Doris looked round, with the rest, and saw some persons
come into a box on the grand tier. Among them
was an old gentleman, tall and thin, with a remarkably
distinguished presence. He wore a blue ribbon across
his waistcoat, but Doris had been attracted more by his
face even than by the ribbon.</p>

<p>It was a handsome face, but there was something in
it, a certain cold and pitiless hauteur, that seemed to
strike a chill almost to Doris’ heart. As he stood in
front of the box, and looked around the house with an
expression of contempt that was just too indolent to be
sheer hatred, she met the hard, merciless eyes and shuddered.</p>

<p>“Who is he, Jeffrey?” she asked, in a whisper, and
touching his arm with a hand that trembled a little.</p>

<p>Jeffrey’s rapt face had been fixed on the stage, but he
turned and looked at the distinguished personage, and
Doris remembered now the sudden pallor of his face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
from which his glittering eyes had flashed like two spots
of red fire set in white ashes.</p>

<p>The look vanished in a moment and he made no reply,
and a few minutes afterward had said:</p>

<p>“It is too hot—let us go.”</p>

<p>Doris recalled the incident now, and wished they had
stopped and seen the great actress; especially as Jeffrey
had always afterward avoided “Romeo and Juliet,” as if
the play had some painful association.</p>

<p>“I shall have to draw on Shakespeare alone for inspiration,”
she thought, looking at the brook. “But, ah! if
only some one could only teach me to say that ‘Good-night,
good-night!’ properly.”</p>

<p>She was repeating the words in a dozen different tones,
and shrugging her shoulders discontentedly over each,
when suddenly there came another sound upon her ears
beside that of her voice and the brook.</p>

<p>It was a dull thud, thud, on the meadow in front of
her, and as it came nearer a voice broke out in a kind of
accompaniment, a voice singing not unmusically:</p>

<p>“The Maids of Merry England, the Merry, Merry
Maids of England!”</p>

<p>There was a hedge on the other side of the brook, and
Doris raised herself on her elbow and looked over.</p>

<p>What she saw was a young man galloping across the
meadow at a breakneck speed, which the horse seemed
to enjoy as much as his rider.</p>

<p>Doris had never seen any one ride like that, and she
was too absorbed in the general spectacle to notice that
the young man was singularly handsome, and that he
made, as he sat slightly in the saddle, with the sunset
rays turning the yellow of his mustache and hair to pure
gold, a picture which Murillo might have painted and
christened “Youth and Health.”</p>

<p>She watched for a moment or two; then, thinking
herself safe from observation behind her hedge, sank
down again, and took up her book.</p>

<p>But the thud, thud, and the “Maids of Merry England”
came nearer and nearer. Then they stopped together,
and a voice, speaking this time, said:</p>

<p>“Hallo, old girl!—over with you!”</p>

<p>The next moment Doris saw horse and rider in the air,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
almost above her head, and the next the horse was on its
knees, with its nose on the ground, and the rider lay
stretched at her feet, as if a hand from the blue sky had
hurled him from his seat.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">OVER THE FENCE.</p>


<p>It had all happened so suddenly that Doris sat for a
moment staring at the motionless figure. Then the color
forsook her face, and she sprang up with a cry, and
looked round for help. There was not a moving thing
in sight excepting the horse, who had picked himself up
and was calmly, not to say contemptuously, grazing a
few yards off.</p>

<p>Doris, trembling a little, knelt down and bent over the
young man. His eyes were closed, and his face was
white, and there was a thin streak of red trickling down
his forehead.</p>

<p>A spasm ran through her heart as she looked, for the
sudden dread had flashed across her mind that—he was
dead.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do?” she cried, and she sprang to
her feet, aroused by the impulse to run for assistance;
but the white, still face seemed to utter a voiceless appeal
to her not to leave him, and she hesitated. No!—she
would not leave him.</p>

<p>She whipped out her handkerchief, and, running to
the brook, dashed it into the water; then, kneeling down
beside him, bathed his forehead, shuddering a little as she
saw that the thin streak of red came again as fast as she
washed it away.</p>

<p>Presently she fancied that she saw a faint tremor upon
the pale lips, and in her eagerness and anxiety she sank
down upon the grass and drew his head upon her knee,
and with faltering hands unfastened his collar. She did
it in pure ignorance, but it happened to be exactly the
right thing to do, and after a moment or two the young
fellow shivered slightly, and, to Doris’ unspeakable relief,
opened his eyes. There was no sense in them for a
spell, during which Doris noticed, in the way one notices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
trivial things in moments of deep anxiety, that they
were handsome eyes, of a dark brown; and that the rest
of the face was worthy of the eyes; and there flashed
through her mind the half-formed thought that it would
have been a pity for one so young and so good-looking
to have died. Then a faint intelligence came into his upturned
gaze, and he looked up into her great pitying
eyes with a strange look of bewilderment which gradually
grew into a wondering admiration that brought a
dash of color to Doris’ face.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he said at last, and the voice that had
sung “The Maids of Merry England” sounded strangely
thin and feeble; “am I—dead?”</p>

<p>It was a queer question. Did he think that it was an
angel bending over him? A faint smile broke over
Doris’ anxious face, and one sprang up to his to meet it.</p>

<p>“I remember,” he said, without taking his eyes from
her face; “Poll pitched me over the hedge.”</p>

<p>He tried to laugh and raise his head, but the laugh
died away with suspicious abruptness and his head sunk
back.</p>

<p>“I—I beg your pardon!” he said. “I must have come
an awful cropper; I—I feel as if I couldn’t move!” and
he made another effort.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” said Doris anxiously; “do not try—yet.
Oh, I am afraid you are very much hurt! Let me——”
she wiped his forehead again. “If there were only some
one else to help,” she exclaimed in a piteous voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t—please don’t you trouble about it,” he
said, pleadingly. “I shall be all right directly. It’s
ridiculous—” he added faintly, but endeavoring to laugh
again. “I feel as if I’d got rusty hinges at the back of
my neck.”</p>

<p>His eyes closed for a moment, for, notwithstanding the
laugh and his would-be light tone, he was in considerable
pain; then he opened them again and let them rest upon
her face.</p>

<p>“You’re awfully good to me!” he said, slowly. “I feel
ashamed—” he stopped, and a deep blush rose through
the tan of his face, for he had suddenly realized that his
head was in her lap, a fact of which Doris was perfectly
unconscious. “Awfully good!” he repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk!” she said, earnestly. “You—you are
not able! Oh! if there was something I could do!
Water! I will get you some to drink,” and she put his
head gently from her and rose.</p>

<p>He smothered a sigh.</p>

<p>“There’s—there’s a flask in my saddle-pocket, if I
could only get at it,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it,” she said, swiftly.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said, quickly. “The—the horse, I mean
might—”</p>

<p>But she was off like the wind, and quite regardless of
danger. The horse raised his head and looked at her,
and apparently seemed to take in the gravity of the situation,
for it stood quite still while she searched the
saddle.</p>

<p>“It is not here!” she said, in a voice of distress.</p>

<p>“No, by Jove, I recollect! I left it at home,” he faltered.
“I’m so sorry! Don’t—please—don’t trouble!”
and he raised himself on his elbow.</p>

<p>She flew from the horse to the brook, then stopped
short for a moment as she remembered that she had nothing
to hold water. He watched her and understood.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he said.</p>

<p>“But there must be some way!” she cried, distressfully.</p>

<p>“If—if you’ll bring some in your hands,” he suggested,
the color coming into his face.</p>

<p>She stopped and made a cup of her two palms, and
turned to him carefully, fearful of spilling a drop.</p>

<p>The young fellow hesitated, and first glanced up at her
face, unseen by her, then bent his head.</p>

<p>When he raised it there was a strange look in his eyes,
and he drew a long breath. Doris dropped her hands
with a sudden swiftness.</p>

<p>Reverently, gratefully as his lips had touched her
hands, their touch had sent a strange thrill through her.</p>

<p>“I—I am afraid you did not get much,” she said, and
her voice faltered, though she strove to keep it firm and
steady.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” he said. “Thank you very much. I am
better—all right now!” and to prove it he sat up and
looked round him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>But his eyes returned to her face almost instantly, as
if loth to leave it.</p>

<p>“I never was so sorry in all my life,” he said. “To
think that I should have given you all this trouble! And—and
frightened you, too!” he added, for she had sunk
down upon the bank and was trembling a little as she
wiped her hands.</p>

<p>“No, no, I am not frightened,” she said. “But it—it
was so sudden.”</p>

<p>He looked round and bit his lip.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens!” he exclaimed, remorsefully, “I—I
might have fallen on to you!”</p>

<p>A faint smile played upon her lips for an instant.</p>

<p>“You nearly did so as it was,” she said.</p>

<p>He drew a long breath, and his eyes sought her face
penitently.</p>

<p>“It was abominably careless of me,” he said in a low
voice. “But I had no idea that there was any one here;
I didn’t think of looking over the hedge.”</p>

<p>“It is a very high one,” she said, and her lips quivered
with a little shudder, as she recalled the moment in
which she saw him fall.</p>

<p>He glanced at it carelessly.</p>

<p>“Polly would have done it if it hadn’t been for the
brook! I’d forgotten that there might be a drop this
side, and——” He stopped short, his eyes fixed upon
her dress, upon which were two or three red spots staining
its whiteness. He put his hand to his head. “Your
dress!” he said. “Look there! I’ve spoiled it!”</p>

<p>She looked down at the stains—they were still wet—and
felt for her handkerchief. It was lying on the grass.</p>

<p>“Will you let me?” he said pleadingly, and he took out
his own handkerchief and tried to wipe out the spots.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she said. “It does not matter.”</p>

<p>“And your hat and book!” He picked them up and
glanced at the latter. “‘Romeo and Juliet!’ You were
reading! What a nuisance I have made of myself. I
shall never forgive myself nor forget your kindness! If
you hadn’t been here——” he stopped.</p>

<p>She seemed to be scarcely listening to him.</p>

<p>He sat down, almost at her feet, and fastened his collar,
his eyes resting on her face. He had seen many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
beautiful women, this young man, but he thought, as he
looked at her, that he had never seen any one so perfectly
lovely.</p>

<p>With a vague feeling of wonder he noticed that her
hair was dark, almost black, and yet her eyes were blue.
They were hidden now between the long, dark lashes,
and yet he knew they were blue, for he remembered
noticing it in the first moments of wandering consciousness.</p>

<p>Was it this strange contrast, the blue eyes and black
hair, that made her so lovely? Or was it the shape of the
thin, delicate red lips? He tried to answer the mental
question, but his brain seemed in a whirl.</p>

<p>It was not the effects of his fall, but the witchery of
her presence.</p>

<p>She was so perfectly still, her face set in quiet gravity,
that he feared to speak or move, lest he should disturb
her. Then, suddenly, she looked up with a little start.</p>

<p>“I must go,” she said, almost to herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” he pleaded. “Wait and rest for a little
while!”</p>

<p>She turned her face toward him with a smile, but her
eyes were half veiled by the long lashes.</p>

<p>“It is you that should rest,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m all right,” he said. “But you have had a
fright, and are—are upset, and no wonder. I’m afraid
you’ll never forgive me,” he added, remorsefully.</p>

<p>“Forgive?” she repeated, as if she had not understood.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I’m afraid, if ever we meet again, that
you will think of me as—as the clumsy fellow who nearly
rode over you, and—and gave you all this trouble!”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, simply, “there is nothing to forgive.”</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to his face for a moment as she
spoke. He was still bareheaded, and his hat lay a shapeless
mass in the brook, and the water had formed the
yellow hair into short, crisp curls on his white forehead,
and in his dark eyes lingered the look which they had
worn when he had first returned to consciousness—a
look of hungering, reverent admiration.</p>

<p>She took up her hat and put it on slowly. A spell
seemed to have fallen on her. She thought it was the
reaction after the excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“I must go,” she said. “But you? Shall I send some
one to help you?”</p>

<p>He rose, reluctantly, and laughed softly.</p>

<p>“To help me!” he said. “But I am all right; I never
felt better. It’s not my first tumble by many; and, besides,
I’ve not far to go. But you will let me see you
home? I”—he faltered—“I should like to tell your people,
and thank them——”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she said, her eyes following the direction
which he had taken when he said that he had not far
to go.</p>

<p>“I am staying at the Towers,” he said, responding to
her look. “You know the Towers?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I am staying with my uncle. My name is Neville—Cecil
Neville——” he stopped as if he expected or wished
that she would tell him hers, but Doris remained silent.</p>

<p>“That’s my uncle’s horse, and I hope I haven’t lamed
her!” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Poor thing!” said Doris, pityingly. “It
wasn’t her fault!”</p>

<p>“No, it was all mine,” he said. “And I may not go
home with you? Will you let me call and thank you—properly—to-morrow?”</p>

<p>She raised her eyes with a fleeting glance.</p>

<p>“It is not necessary,” she said.</p>

<p>His face fell. She lingered a moment, then she turned
away.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon.”</p>

<p>He glanced up at the sky.</p>

<p>“Good-night!” he said, slowly. “Good-night!” in so
low a voice that it seemed almost a whisper.</p>

<p>She walked through the clump of trees for a hundred
yards perhaps, then stopped with a start.</p>

<p>In the spell that had fallen upon her, she had forgotten
her book. She looked round and saw that he was standing
where she had left him. She waited, and presently
he moved, and going to the brook, knelt down and
bathed his face and head. Then he went toward the
horse, and calling it to him, got into the saddle. Not
till he had got some distance did she venture to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Her book was there, and beside it the handkerchief
with which he had tried to remove the stains from her
dress; they were there still!</p>

<p>She took it up and looked at it dreamily; the whole
incident seemed almost a dream! and saw in a corner,
worked in red silk, the initials C. N., and above them a
coronet.</p>

<p>She was about to drop the handkerchief where she
had found it, but instead she thrust it out of sight in the
bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>Then with a smile she opened the book.</p>

<p>By a strange coincidence it opened at the page upon
which appeared the words that had proved such a
stumbling-block to her, and half unconsciously she murmured:</p>

<p>“Good-night, good-night!”</p>

<p>What was it that made her start and brought the warm
blood to her face?</p>

<p>Only this, that now for the first time the words seemed
to possess their real meaning. She had learned how to
speak them!</p>

<p>“Good-night! Good-night! Parting is such sweet
sorrow that I shall say good-night till it be morrow!”</p>

<p>She ought to have been glad; why then did she utter
a little cry almost of dismay, and cover her face with her
hands?</p>

</div>

<p class="center">“IF I SHOULD FAIL.”</p>


<p>Doris sped homeward, but, fast as she walked, her
thoughts seemed to outrun her. Had she fallen asleep by
the brook and dreamed it all? She could almost have
persuaded herself that she had, but for the handkerchief
hidden in the bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>“Cecil Neville!” She repeated the name twenty times,
and each time it sounded more pleasant and musical.
There was no need to call up the remembrance of his
face, for that floated before her mental vision as she hurried
on with downcast, dreamy eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“Am I out of my senses?” she exclaimed, at last, trying
to rid herself of the spell by a light laugh. “Any one
would think I was playing the part of a sentimental young
lady in a three-act comedy. It was rather like a play;
but it’s generally the hero who saves the life of the principal
lady. I didn’t save his life, though he says I did.
How he said it! Why can’t one speak like that on the
stage, now? Cecil Neville!”</p>

<p>She took out the handkerchief and looked at it.</p>

<p>“And this is a coronet. What is he, I wonder? A
duke, or an earl, or what? And what does it matter to
me what he is?” she asked herself in the next breath. “I
may never see him again, and if I did we should meet as
strangers. Dukes or earls have nothing in common with
actresses. I wish I could forget all about him. But I
can’t—I can’t,” she murmured, almost piteously. “Oh, I
wish I had stayed at home, and yet I don’t, either,” she
added, slowly. “If I had not been there, perhaps he
would not have come to, and might be lying there now!”
she shuddered. “How brave and strong he looked riding
at the hedge; it was a mad thing to do! And yet he
made light of it! Ah, it is nice to be a man—and such a
man! Cecil Neville! I wish he had not told me his
name! I cannot get it out of my head. And he lives
with his uncle at the Towers. Perhaps Jeffrey knows
who the uncle is. I must tell him,” she sighed. Somehow
she felt a strong reluctance to speak of the afternoon’s
adventure; but she had never had any secrets from
Jeffrey, and she added with another sigh: “Yes, I must
tell him. He will be angry—no, he is never angry, but
he will be—what? sorry. And yet I could not help it.
It was not I who rode at the hedge, and—I wonder what
he thought of me when he came to?” A burning blush
rose to her face, and she stopped still to contemplate the
new phase of the question. “I—I had his head upon
my lap! Oh, what could he have thought? That I was
forward and impertinent, and yet, no, he did not look as
if he did, and—and he thanked me and asked me to forgive
him—how many times! Cecil Neville. There”—and
she laughed impatiently—“that is the last time I will think
of his name—or him!”</p>

<p>With this prudent resolve she hurried on, and burst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
into the little room out of breath, to find Jeffrey seated
at the table and waiting for his supper.</p>

<p>He looked up with his keen glance, and nodded.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry I’ve kept you waiting, Jeffrey,” she said,
humbly, as she threw her hat on the sofa and went to
the table.</p>

<p>“No matter,” he said; “you have been walking up and
down in the fields studying, I know,” and he nodded.
“It is just the hour, the mystic gloaming, when the brain
quickens and ideas are born.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, her long lashes covering her eyes. “I
have been in the fields, and, Jeffrey, I’ve had an adventure!”</p>

<p>“Cows?” he said, absently. “There is nothing like the
open air for such work as you have in hand. Rachel,
the greatest actress of her time, or any other, did most
of her work in the open air——”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t cows,” she broke in, trying to speak in a
matter-of-fact voice; “it was a horse,” and she laughed
a little nervously.</p>

<p>“My kingdom for a horse,” he quoted, failing to see the
unusual color in her face, and not observing that she was
making a mere pretense of eating, just breaking a piece of
toast with her fingers and sipping her coffee. “And are
you more satisfied now? I have only just come from the
theatre; the booking is the heaviest they have had for
years. I have persuaded the manager to increase the orchestra!
Have you seen your dress? It has come, and
I had it sent up to your room.”</p>

<p>“I did not go up; I will try it on directly.”</p>

<p>He pushed his chair back, and began walking up and
down the room, his hands crossed behind his bent back,
his head drooping, his glittering eyes fixed on the floor.</p>

<p>Doris knew that it was hopeless to attempt to speak of
anything but the play, but she made another effort, for
conscience sake.</p>

<p>“Do you know who lives in that large place on the hill,
Jeffrey, the—the Towers, it is called?”</p>

<p>He shook his head with distinct indifference.</p>

<p>“No; some marquis or other. What does it matter?”
he added, impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I saw the nephew of the marquis—if he is a
marquis—this afternoon. He fell off his horse——”</p>

<p>“Yes!” he said, with profound indifference. “I remember
a manager who put horses on in the first scene of
‘Romeo and Juliet.’ It was effective—but unnecessary.
By the way, take care how you arrange your train in the
ballroom scene; leave Romeo room to get near you without
having to draw it on one side; it attracts attention
from the action of the play at a most important moment.
A detail; but it is the details that, massed together, make
or mar the whole.”</p>

<p>She made yet another effort.</p>

<p>“I was going to tell you about the accident, Jeffrey.”</p>

<p>He started, and, stopping in his walk, confronted her
with alarm in his face.</p>

<p>“What accident? I have only just left the theatre; it
was all right then! Oh, you allude to the man who tumbled
off his horse? Never mind; put it out of your
head; don’t think of anything but your part. Have you
finished your supper?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, with a sigh and a smile; it was, indeed,
utterly useless to make any further attempt.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let us go over the balcony scene,” and
he snatched up the book and turned to the page with nervous
fingers.</p>

<p>Doris rose and opened her lips; then, with a sudden
blush, that was as quickly followed by a strange pallor,
she went to him and gently took the book from his hand.</p>

<p>“Not to-night, not again, Jeffrey,” she said, with a
nervousness that was strange in her. “I—I could not!
Don’t be angry, but”—she looked from side to side with
a strangely troubled air—“I—I don’t think I could do it
to-night! Don’t ask me!”</p>

<p>He nodded once or twice, looking at her meditatively.</p>

<p>“I think I understand,” he said, as if to himself. “You
are afraid of getting hackneyed? Perhaps you are right.
Yes, you are right,” he added, quietly; “there is such
a thing as over-training. Yes, I know what you mean.
Better let it rest for to-night, after the rehearsal this
morning and the study this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Doris turned her head away with a guilty sense of having
deceived him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“It is not that,” she faltered, “but——” She stopped,
and going to him suddenly, hid her face on his shoulder.
“Oh, Jeffrey, if I should fail to-morrow!”</p>

<p>He patted her arm soothingly.</p>

<p>“There’s no such word for us, Doris,” he said, with
grim confidence. “Don’t speak of failing. Fail! What,
after all these years!”—his voice grew hoarse. “Why,
child, what is the matter with you to-night?” he broke off
in alarm, for he could feel that she was crying softly, and
crying was by no means one of Doris’ customary habits.</p>

<p>She raised her head, and hastily wiping her eyes,
laughed.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with me, Jeffrey? I wish I
knew. Perhaps it’s the excitement! There, I’m all right
now,” and she slid away from him.</p>

<p>The old man seized her arm, and looked into her face
intently.</p>

<p>“Doris!” he said, in a husky voice; “you—you are not
unhappy?”</p>

<p>“Unhappy!” and she laughed again. “Why should I
be unhappy? Perhaps I cried because I’m too happy!
Grief and joy are next of kin, you know. And oughtn’t
I to be filled with joy, I, the Doris Marlowe, who is to
play Juliet to-morrow night?”</p>

<p>His hand dropped from her arm, but he was only half-satisfied.</p>

<p>“If I thought——” he muttered. “Doris, you are all
the world to me! Before Heaven I have had no thought
but for you since”—he stopped abruptly—“since you became
my care; day and night, early and late, I have
worked to one end—to make you great and famous and
happy! If I thought——” he wiped the perspiration
from his brow, and looked at her almost wildly.</p>

<p>“I know, I know! Dear, dear old Jeffrey!” she murmured,
soothing him with touch and voice. “No, I don’t
know, but I can guess all you have been to me, all you
have done for me. And I am happy, very, very happy!
And I will be great and famous if you wish it! You
shall see!” she said, nodding, and smiling through the
tears that veiled her lovely eyes. “Wait till to-morrow
night. There, it is you who are excited now! And now
I’m going to try my dress on. We must look the Juliet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
if we cannot act her,” and she stooped and kissed his forehead
and ran from the room.</p>

<p>The old man stood where she had left him, his hands
working behind his back, his brows knotted into thick
cords, his eyes fixed on the ground.</p>

<p>Doubt, almost remorse, were depicted on his countenance
with an intensity almost terrible. He sank into a
chair, and, covering his face with his hands, seemed lost
in a dream. Presently the door opened, and Doris, like
a vision of loveliness, stood in her white satin dress before
him.</p>

<p>She held the long train in one hand, and in the other
a candle above her head, and stood with a grave smile
upon her beautiful face, waiting. He looked up, then
with a sudden cry threw out his arms.</p>

<p>“Lucy, Lucy, I did it for the best, for the best!”</p>

<p>“Jeffrey!” exclaimed Doris, “Jeffrey!” and she hastened
toward him in alarm; but the sound of her voice
had recalled him to himself, and, passing his hand across
his forehead he rose and looked at her.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” he said, still in a half-dazed manner. “Yes,
it will do. Doris, you are very beautiful.”</p>

<p>She colored and shook her head.</p>

<p>“What a wicked thing to say, you flatterer! But, Jeffrey,
why did you call me Lucy?” she asked, bending over
him, her brows drawn together anxiously.</p>

<p>“Did I?” he replied, evasively. “I—I must have been
dreaming. There—ask me no more questions. The
dress is perfect. Perfect!” he repeated, emphatically, but
looking at her face and not the dress. “Walk across the
room.” She did so. “Now, stand as I showed you.
So! Yes, yes,” he murmured with a sigh of satisfaction;
“perfect! You look the part, Doris; not one of them
could look it better—no! And to-morrow”—he stopped
and regarded her with an earnestness that was almost
fierce. “Child, if you fail to-morrow, you will kill me!
Go now; go to bed and rest. Go!” he repeated, still looking
at her, but waving her away with his hand as if she
recalled some memory too painful to be borne; and Doris,
stooping and kissing him, went up to her own room
again. There she stood before the glass and looked at
herself with a scrutiny that she had never used before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>Jeffrey had called her beautiful. Was she really beautiful?
Did others think her so?—did he? She took up
the handkerchief and looked at it dreamily; then, still in
her Juliet dress, she joined her hands together as she had
done when she had made a cup for him; and as she did
so, the warm blood rushed to her face, for she could almost
fancy that even now she could feel the touch of his
lips and the golden moustache upon the soft, pink palms.</p>

<p>Rest! If to lie awake until the clock struck midnight,
and then to fall asleep and dream that she was still bending
over the handsome face, all pale but for the thin
streak of red; to hear in her sleep the strong, musical
voice murmuring, “Will you forgive me?” was rest—then
Doris was resting, indeed!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">AT THE TOWERS.</p>


<p>Cecil Viscount Neville rode off at a gallop at first, but
presently he pulled the horse up into a walk, for he
wanted to think. Something had happened besides his
tumble that afternoon to “shake the soul of him,” as Tasso
says. The blood was coursing through his veins at racing
pace, and his heart was beating violently with a new
and strange emotion. It seemed to him that he had been
in fairyland.</p>

<p>Just as Doris had taken out the handkerchief and
looked at it to convince herself that she had not been
dreaming, so he put his hand to the cut on his forehead
to help him to realize that imagination had not been playing
pranks with him.</p>

<p>He had seen beautiful women; in the language of his
world he had had some half-a-dozen of them at least
“pitched at his head;” but this one——</p>

<p>He stopped the horse, and recalled her face as it had
looked down upon him when he came back to consciousness.</p>

<p>“I thought I was dead and that she was an angel!” he
murmured, his face flushing. “There never were eyes
like hers! And her voice! And I don’t know her name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
even! And I may never see her again! I must, I must!
And I might have ridden over that beautiful creature—she
might have been lying there instead of me!” he shuddered.
“I ought to have killed myself, clumsy, awkward
idiot! But she forgave me, yes, she forgave me!” and
he tried to recall, and succeeded in recalling, every word
she had spoken. “I wonder who she is?” he asked himself
for the hundredth time. “Why didn’t I ask her her
name? No, I remember I could not! I—I never felt
like that before, never! I felt actually afraid of her!
I’ve half a mind to ride back—would she be angry, I wonder?
I didn’t thank her enough. Why, I behaved like a
fool! She must have thought me one! I’ll ride back
and beg her to tell me who she is. I must know!” and
he was about to turn the horse when the clock of the
Towers solemnly chimed the hour.</p>

<p>He started and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Dinner time,” he murmured, “and it’s a mortal sin
to be five minutes late! No matter, I must go back,” and
he swung round. Then he pulled up again. “No; she
will not like it! It—it will seem as if I were forcing
myself on her, and after all her goodness to me! But not
to know her name even!” and, with something between
a sigh and a groan, he put the horse into a gallop and
rode toward home.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the horse, she had struck her knees
upon the bank, and was uninjured, for Lord Cecil had—with
unusual indifference—quite forgotten her, and it was
not until he had ridden into the courtyard of the Towers,
and met the surprised stare of the groom who came forward,
that he remembered the animal.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a tumble,” he said. “It was my fault, not
Polly’s! Give her an extra feed and wipe down,” he
added, as he patted her. “She isn’t hurt, I’m glad to
say.”</p>

<p>“But you are, my lord, I’m afraid!” said the groom.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Lord Cecil, with a smile, and he hurried
across the courtyard, and up the stone steps to the
terrace.</p>

<p>The long walk, laid in Carrara marble, and running the
whole length of the house, was perfectly empty, and
everything was suspiciously quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“They’ve begun dinner,” said Lord Cecil, with a shrug
of his shoulders. “That’s unpleasant! I don’t know my
uncle very intimately, but I have a shrewd suspicion that
he is the sort of man to cut up rough! Well, no, I don’t
suppose he would be rough if I burned the place down,
but he’d be unpleasantly smooth.”</p>

<p>He hurried along, past a long line of windows, screened
by their curtains, and then past one through which the
light came in innumerable streaks of color—it was the
stained oriel window—and at last reached the great hall.</p>

<p>A groom of the chambers, attired in a dark purple livery
that looked almost like a court suit, came forward with
something like solemn gravity.</p>

<p>“I’m late, eh?” said Lord Cecil, and his clear, young
voice, musical as it was, sounded large and loud in the
solemn, subdued air of the place.</p>

<p>“Dinner has been served twenty-two minutes, my lord,”
was the grave reply.</p>

<p>“Oh! hang the two minutes,” said Lord Cecil, “I
shan’t be long.” And he bounded up the stairs, apparently
to the amazement of the official and a couple of
stately footmen, who looked after him with surprise. It
took him some two or three minutes to reach his room.
The Towers was a huge place, but which, huge as it was,
the marquis only dwelt in for a month or two once in
three or four years—he had so many other and huger
places—and Lord Cecil found his valet waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Look sharp, Parkins,” he said, slipping off his coat.
“I’m awfully late. Has the marquis inquired for me?”</p>

<p>“No, my lord,” said Parkins, as he set about his ministration
with quiet celerity. “Mr. Scobie, the butler, did
mention that his lordship never waited for any one.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it,” said Lord Cecil. “It’s bad enough
to spoil one’s own dinner without ruining other people’s.
All right? What are you fumbling at?”</p>

<p>“I was trying to hide the cut on your forehead, my
lord.”</p>

<p>“Oh! never mind that,” said Lord Cecil, impatiently,
and he hurried down.</p>

<p>The groom came forward with stately step, and led the
way to the dining-room, and opened the door slowly, as if
it were the entrance to the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>It was a magnificent room, so large that it had been
found necessary to curtail its dimensions with screens and
curtains, the last of crimson plush with heavy bullion
fringe. The table was loaded with a splendid service of
plate, and at the head of it sat the Most Honorable the
Marquis of Stoyle, Earl of Braithwaite and Denbigh, of
Scotland, Baron Barranough of Ireland, Knight of the
Garter of England, etc.</p>

<p>He rose with majestic courtesy as Lord Cecil entered,
and the light from the delicately-shaded lamp, falling full
upon his face and figure, made a picture of them calculated
to strike the least observant of mortals.</p>

<p>He was an old man—seventy-two, the “Peerage” says,
and that cannot lie, as somebody remarks—but he was
as straight as an arrow, and save for two lines running
from the corners of his finely-shaped nose, and a few
wrinkles at the ends of his gray, piercing eyes, the face
was as smooth as Lord Cecil’s own; smooth and almost as
pale as ivory; every feature as cleanly cut as if it were
carved in; smooth and cold as ice; and yet, with all its
icelike impassability, a vague, indefinite something, not
marked enough for an expression, which always riveted a
stranger’s gaze, and made him uncomfortable. It was
not exactly contempt, or hauteur, or dislike, but a commingling
of all three, which imparted to the face a quality
hard to define but easy to feel. It should be added, to
complete the picture, that his white hair, worn rather long,
was brushed straight back from his white forehead, and
that the hands were snowy in color and of quite feminine
shape and texture.</p>

<p>This imposing figure stood upright until Lord Cecil
had taken his seat, the hard, steellike eyes regarding him
with an impassive, icelike courtesy, then sank into its seat
again.</p>

<p>It was not until he had done so that Lord Cecil was
startled by seeing that a third person was present, for
he had been unable to remove his eyes from the marquis’
while they were on his face. Now he saw that between
him and the marquis sat a lady; and Lord Cecil, as his
senses woke to the fact of her presence, was guilty of an
astonished stare.</p>

<p>It is not given to every one to meet in one day the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
most beautiful women he had ever seen, but this was Lord
Cecil’s fate. The lady was young, with a fair and perfectly-tinted
face, with dark-brown eyes, and hair that
shone like raw silk under the mellow light that fell from
the candelabra above.</p>

<p>Her presence was so unexpected that Lord Cecil might
be pardoned for expressing in his gaze something of the
surprise he felt.</p>

<p>The sound of the marquis’ voice, low and yet clear, like
the sound of a treble-bell, recalled him to himself and his
manners.</p>

<p>“This is Lord Cecil Neville, Lady Grace,” he said, and
he just moved his snowy hand. “Cecil, I think I told you
that I expected Lady Grace?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil bowed, and the lady inclined her head with
a smile.</p>

<p>“As we are strangers, and Lord Neville has probably
never heard of me, marquis, perhaps you had better add
that I am Lord Peyton’s daughter.”</p>

<p>The marquis bowed.</p>

<p>“Of course I have heard of you, Lady Grace,” said
Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>The dark-brown eyes opposite him grew rather keen
as they rested on his face, but for a moment only, then
she smiled again.</p>

<p>“If I had known that you were here——” He stopped
and laughed. “Well, I was going to say that I’d have
been home earlier, but the fact is I met with a slight
accident and was detained.”</p>

<p>The dark eyes seemed to flash over him, then fixed
themselves upon the cut on his forehead.</p>

<p>“You were not hurt, I hope?” she said. “I see you
have a cut on your brow.”</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “It is nothing.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Lady Grace. The marquis
had not condescended to make any inquiry; indeed,
for any sign or interest he might have been stone deaf.</p>

<p>“Got pitched over a hedge,” he said.</p>

<p>“By a man?” she asked, raising her brows.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“No, by a horse. By the way, sir,” he said, turning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the marquis, “I am glad to say that the horse is not injured.”</p>

<p>“No?” said the marquis, with slow indifference. “Perhaps
that is as well; horses are valuable,” and the tone
more than the words seemed to add—“and men—especially
Lord Cecil Neville—are not.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil glanced at him quickly, but the pale face was
set and impassive, as if innocent of any intent to insult.</p>

<p>After this cheerful remark the conversation rather naturally
languished. Lord Cecil was hungry, and devoted
his attention to his plate; the servants moved to and fro
waiting with subdued and watchful assiduity; the marquis
ate his dinner with slow, wearied glance, his eyes fixed
on the great, golden epergne in the centre of the table, as
profoundly silent as if he never meant to utter another
word. Now and again Lady Grace raised her eyes and
scanned the handsome face opposite her, and Lord Cecil
would have returned the compliment, but while he ate his
dinner he was thinking of that other face with the dark
hair and blue eyes, which had bent over him by the brook,
recalling the sweet voice, which still rang in his ears like
distant music.</p>

<p>He started when the low, soft voice of Lady Grace said:</p>

<p>“Have you been at the Towers long, Lord Cecil?”</p>

<p>It was rather an awkward question, for this was his
first visit to any house of the marquis, his uncle, for ten
years.</p>

<p>“Two days,” he replied, simply.</p>

<p>Lady Grace’s eyes grew keen, and she glanced from the
young man to the old one.</p>

<p>“I have just been trying to tell the marquis how intensely
I admire the place,” she said.</p>

<p>The marquis inclined his head to her in courtly acknowledgment,
but without a word.</p>

<p>“It is the prettiest—no, the grandest—old place I have
ever seen. I am quite surprised to hear that the marquis
seldom visits it. The view from the terrace is simply
magnificent. The country round about must be very
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“I think it is,” said Lord Cecil; the marquis made no
sign. “I haven’t seen much of it.”</p>

<p>“I shall expect you to act as guide to what you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
seen,” she said, with a smile that seemed to flash like a
beam of light from her white face.</p>

<p>“I shall be most happy,” he responded.</p>

<p>“I think the country is at its best in the spring, and I
am always glad to get a little while, a short breathing
time, before the London season commences. Let me see,
you are in the Two Hundred and Fifteenth, aren’t you,
Captain Neville?”</p>

<p>“I was,” said Lord Cecil, with a momentary embarrassment,
and a glance at the marble-like face at the head
of the table. “I have retired.”</p>

<p>“What a pity!” she said, and her eyes seemed to take
in, at a glance, his broad chest and stalwart limbs.</p>

<p>“Do you extend your sympathy to the army or to Lord
Cecil?” asked the marquis, in a voice too smooth for the
sneer which his question conveyed.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil’s eyes flashed, and his color rose, but he contained
himself and smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, for both, of course. Surely the commander-in-chief
cannot afford to lose a good officer, and Lord Cecil
must be sorry to leave the army.”</p>

<p>“No,” murmured the marquis. “I do not suppose the
commander-in-chief can afford to lose a good officer.
Lord Cecil must have been a great loss,” and his icy
glance rested for a moment, without a spark of expression,
upon the handsome face which had flushed again
under his cruel taunt.</p>

<p>“The loss was all on my side, Lady Grace,” he managed
to say, with a smile; “at any rate, the duke bears up
wonderfully well.”</p>

<p>Once more the marquis had succeeded in freezing the
conversation, and Lady Grace, after toying with a strawberry,
rose to leave the table. And as Lord Cecil opened
the door for her, she put up her fan, and in a remarkably
low voice murmured:</p>

<p>“You will not stay long?”</p>

<p>“I certainly sha’n’t,” he replied, emphatically, and in an
equally low voice: but, low as it was, the marquis appeared
to have heard it.</p>

<p>“I shall not detain you long,” he said. “You drink, of
course?” and he touched the decanter.</p>

<p>The tone, and not the words, again seemed to convey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
an insult, and Lord Cecil shook his head, feeling as if he
would rather have perished of thirst than drank a glass of
the wine thus offered.</p>

<p>“No?” said the marquis, and he managed to make even
this single word offensive. “I thought it was the present
custom with young men.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Lord Cecil; “we have changed the fashion.”</p>

<p>The marquis inclined his head as if the retort were a
compliment.</p>

<p>“Ah, the present age has no vices, I presume. Is it
because they have no strength for them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Lord Cecil, almost coldly.</p>

<p>The marquis filled a glass with the rare and costly
wine, and as he sipped it, allowed his eyes to stray over
the rim to his nephew’s face.</p>

<p>“I think I told you Lady Grace was expected?” he said.</p>

<p>“I think not, sir,” said Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“Ah, it escaped me. Her father is an old—friend of
mine.” The pause conveyed the sneer which lay in almost
every sentence he uttered, and was expressed by tone or
word. “He did me a great service, and I owe him a debt
of gratitude.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil looked up inquiringly. The marquis dipped
his white fingers in the finger-glass, and added, smoothly:</p>

<p>“He ran off with a girl to whom I was going to be
married. This is her daughter, and I am naturally—attached
to her.”</p>

<p>The idea of the marquis being attached to any human
being on the face of the earth almost raised a smile on
Lord Cecil’s face. He might have laughed outright; the
marquis would have made no sign. He sipped his wine
slowly, then he said:</p>

<p>“She is what the people call a beautiful girl?”</p>

<p>This was put as a question, and Lord Cecil hastened to
reply:</p>

<p>“She is very beautiful, sir.”</p>

<p>“If you say so!” said the marquis, with an inclination
of the head, which brought the color to Lord Cecil’s face,
and caused him to mutter:</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this much longer.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?” said the marquis, blandly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>In his embarrassment Lord Cecil seized the decanter,
and poured out a glass of wine, and the ghost of a smile
crossed the marquis’ face.</p>

<p>“It is rather singular that Lady Grace should have
mentioned the army,” he said. “It reminded me that I
wanted to speak to you on the subject. First let me thank
you for complying with my desire.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil smiled, but rather grimly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I could have done otherwise, sir,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Ah! true—yes. I think, if I remember rightly, that I
made the continuance of your allowance subject to your
resigning. No doubt you thought the condition rather
arbitrary. Permit me to explain it. I could not afford
it.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil stared in an unfeigned astonishment, which
appeared to give the marquis immense satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I generally avoid business matters,” he said, slowly,
and as smoothly as ever; “I leave them to my steward
and lawyer. But I think we had better speak of them—it
is a good opportunity! It will surprise you to hear,
no doubt, that I am a poor man!”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil certainly looked surprised. The marquis
smiled.</p>

<p>“Y—es,” he said, slowly, as if he enjoyed making the
statement. “It appears that I have spent rather more
than double my income for say fifty years since, and I
imagine that my father and grandfather must have done
the same; at least that is the only way in which I can
account for the fact that the whole of the free estates are
mortgaged up to the neck. Up to the neck,” he added, as
if it were a line of especially beautiful poetry.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil sat silent and attentive.</p>

<p>“The land that couldn’t be mortgaged will, of course,
come to you,” continued the marquis, and his tone conveyed
his infinite regret; “but even the income from that
will be drawn upon to pay the interest on the others.
Consequently,” with bland and icy politeness, “you will
probably be the poorest peer of the realm.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil remained silent, his eyes fixed gravely on
the pale, set face, which bore not the faintest indication
of regret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“It is an uncomfortable position! I cannot imagine a
more deplorable one, can you?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil nodded.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t think I have realized it yet, sir,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the marquis. “But you will. I haven’t
felt it because, you see, I have been able to raise money
for myself! That is unfortunate for you, of course, but
I imagine you would have done the same in my place.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil did not reply. The heartlessness of the
speech simply staggered him.</p>

<p>The marquis waited, as if to give him time to digest
this charmingly candid statement, then remarked, in as
casual a voice as if he were commenting on the weather:</p>

<p>“Lady Grace’s grandfather made his money and his
title out of beer. She will be immensely rich, I believe,
and will not require the small sum—though it will be my
all—which I shall leave her.”</p>

<p>He paused and looked at his white hands, then in an
utterly wearied voice, as if he had exhausted all the interest
in the subject, said:</p>

<p>“I am glad you think her so charming! Pray, do not
let me keep you from her any longer!” and he rose and
stood like a statue.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil pushed his chair back and rose, his handsome
face rather pale, his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“Do I understand, sir—do you want me to understand
that you wish me to——” He hesitated a moment, then
brought it out, bluntly—“to marry Lady Grace?”</p>

<p>The marquis surveyed him from under half-closed eyelids,
as if he were some insignificant object at a distance.</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” he said, smoothly. “I was merely
making an attempt, I fear a vain attempt, to amuse you
by giving you some information. It is”—the words
dropped with icy, contemptuous indifference from his
scarcely moving lips—“a matter of profound indifference
to me whether you marry Lady Grace—or one of the
maids in the kitchen!”</p>

<p>A fierce retort trembled on the tip of Lord Cecil’s
tongue, but he closed his lips tightly, and, returning the
courtly bow which the marquis at this moment accorded
him, with a short inclination of the head, left the room.
The marquis gently sank back into his chair with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
placid and serene air of a man who has spent a remarkably
pleasant quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Outside, in the hall, Lord Cecil pulled himself up and
drew a long breath, as a man does who has kept a tight
hold upon himself for about as long as he can manage;
then he paced up and down the full length of the hall—much
to the concealed amazement of the groom and the
footmen, one of whom stood ready to open the drawing-room
door for him—and, at last, remembering that Lady
Grace was waiting for him, greatly relieved the footman’s
feelings by entering the room.</p>

<p>Lady Grace was reclining, almost completely lying, on
a couch near the fire. At a little distance sat a middle-aged
lady, bent over some kind of needlework. It was a
distant connection of the marquis, who acted as a kind of
housekeeper, and who was more like a shadow than a
living, breathing woman. Beyond his first greeting when
he had arrived, Lord Cecil had not succeeded in exchanging
a word with her. As he entered now she just raised
her head like an automaton, and let it fall again over her
work. Lady Grace looked across at him with a smile,
and he went and leaned against the mantel-piece of carved
marble and mosaic, and she let her eyes scan his face in
silence for a moment, then she said, with a smile:</p>

<p>“Have you been enjoying yourself, Lord Cecil?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very much!” he said.</p>

<p>She laughed a low, soft laugh.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you what you are thinking?” she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>“You were wondering what train you could catch to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>He started.</p>

<p>“Right the first time!” he acknowledged, with a short
laugh.</p>

<p>She moved her fan—it was a large one of fancy blue
feathers—which in juxtaposition with her face made its
fairness seem dazzling.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t,” she said, “for my sake.”</p>

<p>“For your sake?” he said, half-absently.</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t you see that you would leave me alone?
You would not be so cruel! And after two days only.”</p>

<p>“It seems about two years,” he said, grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>She laughed softly, her eyes still fixed on his face, as if
it were a book whose pages she was reading.</p>

<p>“How charming the marquis is, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Charming!” he assented, with a volume of bitterness
in the word.</p>

<p>“You must be so glad to be here with him, and it is the
first time for ten years!”</p>

<p>“And the last for another ten,” he said, under his breath,
but she heard him.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that. After all, he is not so bad when you
know him.”</p>

<p>“There are some people one doesn’t want to know, Lady
Grace.”</p>

<p>“And then we must make allowances,” she said. “Why
do they call him Wicked Lord Stoyle?” she asked him,
not abruptly, but in the same soft voice that most people
found acted upon them like a caress.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. For good and fully sufficient reasons
I’ve no doubt,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Do you think he has murdered anybody, now?” she
inquired, with a smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Perhaps. I daresay. At any rate, I’m
quite sure a great many people must have longed to murder
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fie!” she said, touching him with the edge of her
fan; “and your uncle, too! I wonder what he has done?”</p>

<p>“I was just wondering what he hasn’t done,” said Lord
Cecil, grimly.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“You amuse me, Lord Cecil.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully glad,” he said. “I didn’t think it was in
me to amuse any one to-night.”</p>

<p>“You have had rather a bad quarter of an hour—yes?”
she said, softly. “What a happy woman the marquis’
wife must have been.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil started.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know——” he said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>She laughed, and the fan moved to and fro in rhythmic
curves.</p>

<p>“No? Oh, yes, there was a marchioness once. Years
and years ago. I believe he killed her—with kindness.”</p>

<p>“Poor woman!” he said, under his breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. But that’s the mystery. No one knows, you
see, and never will know. Everybody knows about his
ruining his cousin, Lord Denbigh, at cards; he committed
suicide, and so the marquis inherited the Denbigh title;
and about his shooting old Lady Dalrymple’s son—they
say that the marquis fired before the word was given;
and about his running away with that foolish Lady Penelope—she
died in a garret at Dieppe; but nobody knows
about the marchioness. How shocked you look!”</p>

<p>“Do I?” he said. “I didn’t think I was capable of it.
But surely that isn’t all he has done?” he said, with great
sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; these are trifles which I happened to remember
hearing about. They are only trifles.”</p>

<p>“That is all,” he said.</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment or two; then she said,
in the same voice, too low and soft to reach the old lady
sitting at the other end of the room:</p>

<p>“And now shall I tell you what you are thinking about,
Lord Cecil?”</p>

<p>“Don’t! I’m afraid!” he cried.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“You are wondering why I am here?”</p>

<p>His eyes replied in the affirmative for him.</p>

<p>“Because——But, wait! I am more clever even than
you suppose! Shall I tell you what the marquis has been
saying to you in the drawing-room; and why do you look
so grim and gloomy?”</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>She let her eyes rest upon his face with a serene and
languid expression of amusement.</p>

<p>“Well, then, he has been advising you to marry me.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil was almost guilty of a start.</p>

<p>He could not speak. The color rose to his face, and his
eyes dropped from hers to the diamond pendant that glistened
on the white neck.</p>

<p>She laughed softly, and the diamonds seemed to laugh
with her, as they scintillated in the subdued light.</p>

<p>“Am I right? You need not answer—your face is eloquent
enough! And now I will tell you why I came here—I
came to see you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>He tried to speak, but she held up her fan to command
him to silence.</p>

<p>“You see, I know the marquis and his charming ways
better than you do. I knew that he wished us to meet,
that we might—how shall I put it?—respect each other.
Well, Lord Cecil, I have seen you, and you have seen me.
But”—she rose with slow and graceful ease and took
up the train of her dress—“but you are not obliged to
marry me, and I”—she laughed softly up at his handsome
face—“I am certainly not obliged to marry you. And
now, in reward for my candor—I have been candid,
haven’t I?—you will not leave me alone in this castle of
Giant Despair?”</p>

<p>She did not wait for his answer, but with a soft “good-night”
and a smiling nod, glided from the room.</p>

<p>With the smile still on her face, Lady Grace went slowly
up the great staircase to the magnificent apartments which
had been prepared for her. The smile was still on her
face while her maid brushed the long tresses of silky hair
that fell like a shower of gold over the white shoulders,
and even when she was alone she smiled still as she leaned
forward and looked at her face in the glass.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she murmured, falling back and half-closing her
eyes. “He is worth winning. There is only one thing I
fear.” She paused, with a faint sigh. “I am afraid that
I shall love him too well!”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil stood with his back to the fire for twenty
minutes after Lady Grace had left him. To say that he
was amazed would be only inadequately to describe the
state of his feelings. At last, as if he were making an
effort to cast off the bewilderment which had fallen upon
him, he wished the old lady good-night, and went, not to
his room, but out on to the terrace, for he felt a kind of
craving for the open air, in which he might rid himself
of the effects produced by his insight into his uncle’s
character and the extraordinary candor of Lady Grace.</p>

<p>He drew a long breath as he leaned over the balustrade,
and his brain cleared somewhat.</p>

<p>“If Lady Grace is reading my thoughts at this present
moment,” he murmured, “she’ll know I’m thinking of
that train still! Yes, I’ll be off the first thing to-morrow
morning!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>And with this firm resolution he turned to go back to
the house. As he did so, something white fluttered past
him, blown by the faint night breeze.</p>

<p>He stooped and picked it up, and absently glanced at
it by the light from the window. It was a small hand-bill,
having on it in red letters:</p>

<p class="center">
Theatre Royal, Barton.<br>
“Romeo and Juliet.”<br>
</p>

<p>“Romeo and Juliet!” It was that she had been reading
by the brook. Instantly her lovely face rose before
him, and dispelled all memory of the events of the night.
He stood, looking down at the paper dreamily, wistfully,—seeing,
not it, but the dark hair and blue eyes of the
girl who had bent over him, whose hands his lips had
touched.</p>

<p>“No!” he said, with a sharp sigh; “no, I can’t go, for
she is somewhere here, and I must find her!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">AN IDEAL JULIET.</p>


<p>The hour was approaching. Doris, still in her hat and
jacket, sat in the tiny apartment behind the stage which
served as her dressing-room. She was paler than usual,
and her eyes looked of a deeper and darker blue than
usual; but she was calm, with a calm which Jeffrey could
not attain to.</p>

<p>With his hands folded behind him, his head bent upon
his breast—his favorite attitude—he paced up and down
the narrow limits of the room, like a tiger in its cage,
waiting for his supper.</p>

<p>“Will the house be full, Jeffrey?” asked Doris, presently.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied. “The pit and gallery are full now;
they were waiting at the doors as early as six o’clock.
They are not fools, these Barton people. In some places
you would be sure of playing ‘Romeo and Juliet’ to
empty benches, but not here. It is a flourishing place,
and they are intelligent and educated. They have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
theatre they may be proud of, and they are proud of it.
In some towns the theatre is a neglected barn, and when
that is so, you may take it that the people are uncultivated
and barbaric. Yes—you will have a fair and
patient hearing; I knew that when I chose Barton for
the scene of your great trial. In London there are so
many new Juliets that the critics and the audience have
got incredulous and suspicious—they have seen so many
failures that they go prepared for disappointment; here,
it will be different. They love Shakespeare, they know
you, they will hope for the best, and you will not disappoint
them,” and his eyes glittered down upon her.</p>

<p>Doris smiled.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will hiss me off the stage!” she said, but
she did not say it very fearfully.</p>

<p>He shook his head, and went on in his monotonous
pacing; and presently a familiar sound struck his ear.</p>

<p>“The curtain is up on the farce,” he said. “You had
better begin to dress. Is there anything I can do—anything
I can suggest—anything you would like to ask
me?” he inquired, with his long, thin fingers on the
handle of the door.</p>

<p>Doris shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, Jeffrey, dear; I don’t know of anything, unless
you would get into my skin, and play Juliet instead
of me.”</p>

<p>“You are not nervous?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” she answered; “and that is strange, isn’t
it? No, I feel as calm and easy as if I were going to
play a waiting-maid’s part; but I shall be all on the quiver
when I am standing at the wings, ready to go on.”</p>

<p>He nodded, as if he understood, and went out, sending
her dresser to her.</p>

<p>Doris dressed quietly and slowly. Jeffrey had impressed
upon her the importance of avoiding all hurry
just before her appearance, and she had finished, and
was sitting before the glass, not looking at herself, but
musing, as it seemed, when he came in again.</p>

<p>“Dressed? That is right! The house is crammed!
The manager says it is the best house he has had since
Mr. Irving was here. The boxes look like London
boxes, people in evening dress, and ladies with flowers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>He stood in front of her, and scanned her dress and
get-up keenly.</p>

<p>The dress was of white satin, made quite plainly, with
a long train, its only ornament a row of pearls, which
were not stage jewels, but real, and of great value, and
a present from Jeffrey himself. Her dark hair, looking
black by the light, fell round her exquisitely-shaped face
like a frame, and, caught up by a white ribbon behind,
swept in curving tresses to her shoulders. The faint
touch of rouge—every actress must rouge, whether she
likes it or not—gave the intense blue eyes an added depth
and brilliance, which the long dark lashes veiled now
and again, but to rise and render the brilliance and color
more marked by their temporary concealment.</p>

<p>It was not his way to praise her beauty, but as he
turned away he muttered something that sounded like
approval.</p>

<p>“Did you see any one you know, in front, Jeffrey?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, almost impatiently. “I know no one!
I suppose all the people in the boxes are county people,
I do not know! I only care for the pit and gallery; it
is from them you must get your verdict, the boxes and
stalls will follow suit.”</p>

<p>“Poor county people!” she said, with a smile, but absently.</p>

<p>“Of what are you thinking—the third scene?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Doris started, and the natural color forced its way
through the powder and rouge. She was not thinking
of Romeo and Juliet at all, but of the handsome face
that lay in her lap yesterday afternoon, of the young
fellow whose name was Cecil Neville.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” she said, faltering a little. “I
think I was dreaming, Jeffrey.”</p>

<p>“Then you must wake up,” he retorted firmly, but not
unkindly. “I heard the curtain go down on the farce.
Will you have a glass of wine?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and looked at him with smiling
surprise.</p>

<p>“And you, who are always preaching against it!” she
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“I know,” he admitted; “but to-night——”</p>

<p>The manager knocked at the door. He was a keen
business man, just and not ungenerous, and he nodded
and smiled at the beautiful vision admiringly and encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Beautiful house, Miss Marlowe,” he said, “and in
the very best of tempers; a child might play with them
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Ah, it is only a child who is going to play to them,
Mr. Brown!” said Doris.</p>

<p>He laughed approvingly.</p>

<p>“By George, that’s good! I must remember that.
How do you feel?”</p>

<p>“Frightened out of my life!” said Doris. “Do not be
surprised if I forget my part, and am hissed off!” but her
smile belied her words.</p>

<p>“If you are I’ll close the theatre and take to—market
gardening!” retorted the manager.</p>

<p>“Let her alone! I do not want her to talk!” growled
Jeffrey, and Mr. Brown, shrugging his shoulders and
making a grimace behind the bent back, glanced at his
watch and hurried off, saying—</p>

<p>“Ten minutes, Miss Marlowe!”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes!” said Doris, dreamily. “Leave me now,
Jeffrey, dear.”</p>

<p>He laid his hand on her shoulder and looked down
at her with a world of wistful tenderness and pride and
loving anxiety.</p>

<p>“Do your best, Doris!” he said.</p>

<p>“I will, for your sake, Jeffrey!” she responded, touching
his hand caressingly.</p>

<p>“No, for your art’s,” he said, gravely. “I shall be at
the wings.”</p>

<p>Now that she was left alone, Doris tried to concentrate
her thoughts upon the coming ordeal; but she could
not. Each time she tried to picture herself upon the
stage and speaking the lines set down for Juliet, the
voice of Cecil Neville rang in her ears, and with a low
cry, almost of alarm, she put her hands to her head.</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s stage fright!” said the dresser. “I know
what it is, miss; I’ve had it myself, in my old acting
days. But it will pass off directly you face the house, depend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
upon it. Don’t you be afraid and nervous; for,
Miss Marlowe, I’ve heard that the very first actors feel
like that, some of them every night, too!”</p>

<p>Doris laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Do they, Mrs. Parkhouse?” she said. “Then there
is hope for me. There is the overture over. Not many
minutes now; the curtain is up!”</p>

<p>She bent her head upon her hands and forced herself
to think of the scene that was at that moment being
played, to think of the good-looking young fellow—a
great Barton favorite—who was playing Romeo; but
marvel of marvels, instead of his face, which she knew
so well, there rose before her, as Romeo, the face over
which she had bent yesterday.</p>

<p>“Ah, it is no use, no use!” she cried, springing up.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that, miss!” said Mrs. Parkhouse, who
had been watching her with respectful anxiety. “I’m sure—we’re
all of us sure and certain that it will be a success.
It will all go right directly you get on to the
stage.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” said Doris, with a curious smile.
“I hope so—ah, I hope so; if not——”</p>

<p>“Juliet!” shouted the call boy; and leaving her sentence
unfinished, Doris caught up her train and went to
the wings.</p>

<p>The Barton Theatre was a properly conducted one,
and none but those who had business there were permitted
behind the scenes; but Doris had to pass
through a small crowd of actors and supernumeraries and
carpenters, and she felt rather than saw the curious
glances bent upon her.</p>

<p>But instantly Jeffrey was by her side.</p>

<p>“It has gone well, so far,” he said. “Mr. Brown was
right; the house is in good humor, notwithstanding the
heat and that it is packed. You played well, Mr. Garland,”
he said to the Romeo, who came striding up and
bowed to Doris.</p>

<p>“Did I? Thanks. Not nearly so well as I shall do
when I have Juliet to play to. May I, without offense,
say that you are looking your part most beautifully, Miss
Marlowe?”</p>

<p>Doris inclined her head with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“Romeo should pay compliments, Mr. Garland, and
that is a very pretty one. But I want to do more than
look my part!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said the young fellow, gallantly
and seriously. “I haven’t the slightest fear of the result.
It will be a big hit; I have said so all along.”</p>

<p>“And you should know!” said Doris. “I wish I felt
as sure.”</p>

<p>“Your cue!” said Jeffrey in a solemn voice, as he
touched her arm warningly.</p>

<p>She started slightly, then with the light, careless gait
of a light-hearted, careless girl, who has no forecast of
the doom hanging over her, she went upon the stage.</p>

<p>A greater part of the audience knew her, but they
were astonished by the sight of her beauty, rendered
more beautiful by the exquisite dress, and they led the
thunder of welcome which the strangers, who saw her
for the first time, followed as heartily.</p>

<p>Doris had been taught by Jeffrey that to stop the
business of the scene to acknowledge applause was a
cardinal sin, and commenced at once, and the crowded
house fell into instant silence, in which her sweet, clear
voice rang like a silver bell.</p>

<p>A round of applause marked the close of the scene,
but there was not much enthusiasm in it.</p>

<p>She had looked a very typical Juliet, had played her
part well, but there was nothing extraordinary in her
acting.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Miss Marlowe!” said Romeo, as she
passed him at the wing. “Saving yourself up! Reserve
force, and all that! Quite right! You’ll let yourself go
in the later scenes!”</p>

<p>“Well?” she said to Jeffrey, as he threw a silk shawl
over her and drew her into a corner out of the draughts.</p>

<p>“It is for you to answer that,” he said, quietly. “It
was well done; quietly and with self-possession.”</p>

<p>“I see!” she said, growing pale. “I have failed!”</p>

<p>“No!” he almost shouted; then, in a low voice that
quavered: “It is not your best scene. It ought to be
cut out. It is sometimes. You have nothing to fear.
Did you see the house?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“No, I did not look.”</p>

<p>He nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Take no notice of them! Don’t look
beyond the footlights, and—and—the next scene is a
trying one—but I don’t want to make you nervous!”</p>

<p>“You will not make me nervous,” she said, almost sadly.
“I wish that I could feel it more than I do——”</p>

<p>She turned away, and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>The ballroom was set, crowds of supers were hurrying
on to the stage; the orchestra was playing the familiar
music; the audience were applauding the really
handsome scene. Then her time came, and she went on,
and the house listened and watched with rapt attention.
When she went off, there was a distinct round of applause,
but still not enthusiastic; the fire was wanting
yet!</p>

<p>There were two London critics in the stalls, and they
exchanged glances and comments.</p>

<p>“Awfully pretty girl!” said one.</p>

<p>“And a lady. Plays well, too,” responded the other.</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” assented the first. “Not at all badly, but,
somehow, doesn’t she strike you as being out of the
part, so to speak? Seems as if she were going through
it in a dream! But she’s as beautiful as a dream, too!”</p>

<p>The balcony scene came on—the scene in which a
Juliet, who is a Juliet, can display her powers to the
best advantage. In this scene are opportunities for the
display of love and tenderness, maidenly fear and modesty,
and womanly passion, which no other play can afford.</p>

<p>Jeffrey, pacing to and fro behind the wings, with
fingers lacing and unlacing themselves, was devoured by
anxiety, mitigated by hope.</p>

<p>“Now or never!” he muttered. “This is the scene! Oh!
Doris, Doris! Now you raise my heart to the seventh
heaven, or break it!—break it!”</p>

<p>“Awfully pretty scene, Miss Marlowe,” said Romeo,
as they stood together for a moment or two; “you’ll let
yourself go now, I expect!”</p>

<p>“Shall I?” she said, dreamily, almost absently. “I
don’t know.”</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I think I’d put all I know into this,” he said,
gently and respectfully. “It’s a big scene for both of
us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, in a low voice. Then she glided past
him and took her place on the balcony.</p>

<p>The scene began, the audience was as silent as the
grave, as Romeo entered and made his well-known
speech.</p>

<p>Then Doris moved forward to the edge of the balcony,
and into the glare of limelight that poured down upon her.</p>

<p>And then a strange thing occurred. As she sighed,
that well-known sigh, she raised her eyes and all unconsciously
looked toward the house.</p>

<p>It was almost darkened; but a single light had been
left in the chandelier, and it fell upon the handsome face
of a young man sitting in the centre box. He was leaning
forward, his eyes fixed upon her face, a strange intent
expression in them. His face was pale, his hands
clasped tightly on the velvet lining of the box-edge, his
whole expression that of one surprised, amazed, bewildered
and fascinated.</p>

<p>She saw the face for a moment only, but she recognized
it.</p>

<p>It was the one over which she had bent on the preceding
day; it was Cecil Neville’s!</p>

<p>The color rose to her face, and her hands, clasped
tightly on the balcony edge, trembled. Then she went
pale again, and her eyes were raised to the moon.</p>

<p>Then she spoke, and again, marvel of marvels! the
very tones of her voice seemed altered. There was no
longer any trace of the cold abstraction which had
marred the preceding scenes.</p>

<p>Melting, ravishing, they fell upon the audience like
drops of dew upon sun-baked travelers.</p>

<p>A thrill seemed to run through the house. Romeo,
experienced actor as he was, felt the change, the difference,
and actually almost faltered.</p>

<p>Then they took up the scene. No need to dwell upon
it; every one knows it; there is no other like it in the
whole range of English literature.</p>

<p>Like notes of music, sounding the full depths of a girl’s
pure passion, her words dropped from her perfect lips.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Her face was like a poem of Dante Gabriel Rosetti’s;
pale, passion-pale, yet eloquent. Every gesture—as she
swept the dark, silky hair from her forehead with an impatient
movement; as she bent forward in the keen hope
of touching Romeo’s hand; as she kissed her fingers to
him; as she pressed her throbbing heart, full to o’erbrimming
with love—every gesture was noted and dwelt upon
by the enraptured audience, and when the scene closed,
a wild and unanimous burst of applause rolled like
thunder from pit to boxes, from boxes to pit!</p>

<p>They clapped, they stamped, they cheered. It almost
seemed as if a crowd of rational beings had taken leave
of their senses. In plain truth, she had witched the
hearts out of them, and they were fascinated.</p>

<p>Romeo stood, for the first time in his experience, at a
loss what to do, till there rose from the pit a cry, “Juliet,
Juliet!” Then he went to the wings and, breathless,
grabbed at her hand.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he said, excitedly.</p>

<p>But Jeffrey held her fast by the arm. He was pale and
trembling, but his voice was stern and grim.</p>

<p>“No!” he said. “Not yet! This is nothing. Let them
wait till the last scene; then—then, if they want her, she
shall go, but not till then!”</p>

<p>The two London critics in the stalls exchanged
glances.</p>

<p>“Wonderful bit of acting,” said one. “Really wonderful
for so young a girl!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the second; then he added thoughtfully,
“I wonder what made her wake up. It came quite
suddenly, did you notice?”</p>

<p>There was one person in the theatre, one out of the
whole crowd, however, who neither clapped nor cheered,
but sat perfectly silent. It was Lord Cecil Neville. He
sat, breathing slowly and heavily, like one under a spell,
his eyes fixed on the spot where she had stood, all his
senses in thrall.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A BUNCH OF VIOLETS.</p>


<p>He had spent the greater part of the day looking for
her, his disappointment growing hour by hour as he
grew convinced that he should not find her; that he had
lost her forever. If he had only known her name, he
could have inquired in the town; but he could scarcely
go about asking people if they had happened to see the
loveliest girl on earth, with dark hair and wonderful blue
eyes; besides, there was, to him, something almost sacred
in his meeting with her, and he shrank from putting
commonplace questions about her.</p>

<p>By luncheon time he was, I am sorry to say, in anything
but a good temper. Fortunately the marquis rarely
put in an appearance at that meal, or, in all probability,
there would have occurred an open quarrel between him
and his nephew, and Lord Cecil would have fled the
house. Lady Grace, too, did not appear; she had gone
to pay a visit to a friend in the neighborhood, and Lord
Cecil, therefore, ate his cutlet and drank his Chateau
Margaux in solitude.</p>

<p>He was not at all sorry for this, for, to tell the truth,
Lady Grace’s candor, though extremely original, had
very much embarrassed him, and Lord Cecil was too little
used to embarrassment to find it agreeable. She was
very beautiful, very charming, and he admired her very
much, but still he felt her absence a relief; he was free
to muse over the unknown, who had eluded his search all
the morning.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he finished his last glass of claret, he remembered
the play-bill he had picked up on the terrace,
and it occurred to him that here was the means of escaping
dinner at the Towers; for this night, at all events, he
could get away from the marquis’ sneers and sarcasm.</p>

<p>“I shall not be home to dinner,” he said to the stately
butler. “I think I’ll go to the theatre.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” responded the butler, displaying not a
sign of the disgust which the announcement caused him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
To think that any one—a viscount, especially—should
prefer going to the play to dining!</p>

<p>“What sort of a theatre is it?” asked Lord Cecil, carelessly,
and for the sake of talking.</p>

<p>“Very good, my lord, I believe,” was the solemn reply.
“I’ve heard that it’s almost as good as a London
theatre, and that there is an excellent company there.
They play ‘Romeo and Juliet’ to-night. That is,” he
made haste to add, “I heard some of the under-servants
talking about it; I never go to the theatre myself, my
lord. I will send a small dinner, of three or four courses,
at an early hour in the breakfast room, for you, my lord.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Lord Cecil, carelessly. “That will
give you a lot of trouble, will it not? I can get a chop
or something at the hotel in the town, can’t I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, my lord; it will be no trouble,” the butler
made haste to reply; “the marquis would be much annoyed
if your lordship were to be inconvenienced.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil nodded; he could scarcely suppress a smile
at the butler’s crediting the marquis with such hospitable
sentiments.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, again; “I’ll have it at half-past
six.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” assented the butler, with a faint sigh;
it seemed to him a dreadful sacrifice; and Lord Cecil
soon afterward took up his hat and went out.</p>

<p>He made his way to the meadows, and stood looking
down on the brook and at the spot where Polly had
landed him so nearly upon his head; and at the bank
where the fair unknown, whose face and voice haunted
him perpetually, had sat, and a vague hope dwelt in his
breast that she might, perhaps, revisit the scene as he
was doing.</p>

<p>But an hour passed and she did not come, and he
strode off, moodily, full of disappointment and half
angry with himself.</p>

<p>“I am a fool!” he thought. “She has forgotten me by
this time. Why should she come back here? If I were
to meet her, what could I say to her? She’d very likely
think me an impertinent snob if I did more than lift my
hat. I couldn’t very well tell her that I have scarcely
thought of anything but her since we parted yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and to say anything less to her would seem to me to be
saying nothing at all!”</p>

<p>Thus musing, he went into the town, his stalwart
figure, with its military carriage, his handsome, patrician
face, and his Poole-made clothes, which he wore as if
they had grown on him, causing no little sensation
amongst the inhabitants.</p>

<p>But though he stared into the shop windows and
looked at every girl who came in sight, he did not see
the girl of whom he was thinking; and it was nearly
seven before he came back to the “small dinner of three
or four courses” which the considerate butler had served
for him in the breakfast room.</p>

<p>He was half inclined to give up the idea of the
theatre, and if it had not been for his dread of the marquis’
society he would have done so. As it was, he ate
his dinner slowly, and enjoyed it, although he was in
love; and then, and not till then, he fully made up his
mind to go.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a brougham round in ten minutes, my lord,”
said the butler, but Lord Cecil declined it.</p>

<p>“I’d rather walk,” he said. “I like a stroll after
dinner.”</p>

<p>The butler—more in sorrow than in anger—asked
what time he should send the carriage, but Lord Cecil
declined a conveyance for any part of the evening.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk back,” he said; “I rather like a stroll after
the theatre,” and the butler, with a sigh of resignation,
gave him up as a bad job.</p>

<p>As he walked along the lanes, fragrant with the breath
of spring, a thought—a hope—flashed through his mind
that he might, perhaps, see the girl in the theatre. He
never asked himself what his object in seeking her might
be; men seldom ask themselves such questions. Lord
Cecil was not an altogether bad character. He was not
a modern Lovelace in pursuit of his prey, by any means.
He was not, in fact, a Lovelace at all. He had lived in a
fast set—had been the star and centre of the crack regiment
in which he had held a commission—had gone
through the ordeal of London life as completely as most
young men of title; but he had come out of it, if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
could be said to have come out of it, not altogether unscathed,
but not very badly burned or smirched.</p>

<p>The Nevilles had always been wild, and Lord Cecil had
not been any tamer than his ancestors; but in all his wildness
he had drawn the line. For women in general—for
the sex, as a whole—he possessed a respect which had
sometimes amused his less scrupulous companions.</p>

<p>He had overspent his allowance; lost large sums at
baccarat and kindred games, turned night into day,
risked his money and his neck at steeplechases, and generally,
as his friends put it, played Old Harry, but no
woman had, as yet, any indictment against him. He could
truthfully declare, with the Frenchman, on his deathbed:
“No woman can come to my grave and say that for want
of heart I broke hers.”</p>

<p>To women he was always frank and gentle, and the
women of his set adored him. If he had broken no
hearts in the sterner sense of the word, he had all unwittingly
caused many to ache, and many a belle of the
London season had “given herself away” to Cissy Neville,
as his intimate friends called him.</p>

<p>And now the marquis had intimated that he must
marry Lady Grace. Lord Cecil thought of last night’s
after-dinner conversation as he strolled along, tried to
think of it gravely and seriously, but somehow he could
not; all his thoughts flew, whether he would or would
not, to the dark-haired, blue-eyed girl he had so nearly
ridden over in the meadows. After all, he was not
obliged to marry Lady Grace. The marquis could not
compel him, and as for the money—— He shrugged his
shoulders, and, having reached the theatre, put the subject
from him.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that he followed the box-keeper
to the private box he had taken with rather doubtful anticipations.</p>

<p>“Romeo and Juliet” in a country theatre is not always
an entrancing spectacle, and Lord Cecil only wondered
how long he should stand it. He was rather surprised
at the air of elegance perceptible, and still more surprised
at the crowded state of the house, and he congratulated
himself, as he looked round at the well-dressed and aristocratic
audience, that he had come in evening dress, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
he had at one time thought of retaining his morning
clothes.</p>

<p>He settled himself in his box—he had arrived during
the <i>entr’acte</i>—and looked at the programme.</p>

<p>“Juliet—Doris Marlowe.”</p>

<p>The name struck him at once as a pretty one, and he
did not trouble to read the rest of the cast. Then the
curtain drew up on the balcony scene, and, leaning forward
carelessly, he looked at the stage and saw, there
in the balcony—the girl for whom he had been seeking,
the girl with the dark hair and blue eyes!</p>

<p>For a moment he thought he was dreaming, and the
color rushed to his face. Then he looked again, “all his
soul in his eyes,” and saw that he was not dreaming, but
that it was in solemn truth she, herself.</p>

<p>If he had had any doubts her voice would have dispelled
them. He would have remembered and recognized
those musical tones if he had heard them fifty
years hence instead of as many hours.</p>

<p>He was amazed, bewildered, engrossed, but not too
engrossed to be aware that the “Juliet” he looked upon,
Miss Doris Marlowe, was a great actress.</p>

<p>If she moved the rest of the vast audience, imagine
how she moved him who had been thinking of her and
longing to see her!</p>

<p>His heart beat wildly, the color came and went in his
face; he was lost to everything but that bright, celestial,
and yet purely human, being on the stage, then rendering
the exquisite lines of her part; and it was not until
he caught one or two curious glances directed at him
that he drew back a little and tried to look simply interested
like the rest.</p>

<p>The drop scene went down on the act, and he, to use
his own phrase, “pulled himself together.”</p>

<p>He got up and went out into the lobby, and made his
way to the refreshment bar; and when he had obtained
his brandy and soda he lingered over it and got in conversation
with the attendant.</p>

<p>“This Miss Doris Marlowe is a great success?” he
said, trying to speak indifferently.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she is, indeed,” said the girl, with a long
sigh; she had dreamed of being an actress herself, poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
thing; “I just stole out and looked in at the last act. A
success?—I should think so! I call it magnificent. I
never saw anything like it; did you, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, never,” responded Lord Cecil. “She is a London
actress, I suppose? And yet I don’t remember seeing
her in London,” he added.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think she’s ever played in London, but
always in the provinces. This is the first time she’s ever
done anything like this. She’s played here in small
parts; this is her first appearance in Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>“Who is she?” he asked, endeavoring to make his
question commonplace, yet feeling that he was hanging
on her reply.</p>

<p>The girl paused in the wiping of a glass and looked
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Who is she? I don’t know, sir. I question whether
anybody knows rightly, excepting Mr. Jeffrey.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Jeffrey? Who’s he?” asked Lord Cecil, with a
sharp pang. Could this man be her husband?</p>

<p>“Oh, the old gentleman who goes about with her. He
ain’t her father, but a kind of guardian. He was an actor
once. It was he, so they say, who taught her to act.
Anyhow, she treats him just like a father.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p>“They are always together; they go from theatre to
theatre. He is a very extraordinary old gentleman, and
very trying at rehearsals, so I’ve heard the actors say;
but he knows all about it, quite as well as the stage manager.”</p>

<p>At this moment the two London critics came up for
a drink, and one of them bowed to Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“Quite an eventful evening, my lord,” he said, with
the easy respect of a fellow-Londoner.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lord Cecil. “It is a great success, I suppose.
Do you know who Miss Doris Marlowe is?”</p>

<p>The critic shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Haven’t the least idea. Quite a <i>stella incognita</i>, but
she will not be so after to-night. We shall see her in
Drury Lane before many months are passed.”</p>

<p>“Who was that?” his friend, the other critic, asked.</p>

<p>“Lord Cecil Neville,” was the reply. “The heir to
the Marquisate of Stoyle. A splendid fellow, and, strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
to say, not a bit spoiled, though all the women make a
dead set at him.”</p>

<p>“The Marquis of Stoyle,” said the other thoughtfully.
“That old villain? And this is his nephew. He is immensely
good-looking.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a splendid fellow. Did you ever hear that story
about him——?” and they moved away.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil drank half his soda and brandy, and then
went back to his box.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a thrill of excitement seemed to run
through those engaged behind the scenes. A theatre is
rendered famous by its actors, and it seemed that the
Theatre Royal, Barton, was going to be made celebrated
as the place of the first appearance of a great actress.</p>

<p>“If she can only carry us through to the end!” muttered
Jeffrey, as he paced to and fro, his hands clasped
behind his back, his eyes flashing fire.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll do it!” said the manager, who happened
to hear him. “Don’t you be afraid, Mr. Jeffrey; that
young lady is a genius! I knew it from the first. She
will carry it through to the very last. And about the
engagement now? You make your own terms, and I’ll
agree to them. You’ll find me straight and honest——”</p>

<p>But Jeffrey paced on. He was an old theatrical hand,
and he knew, full well, that a Juliet may score in the balcony
scene and yet fail in the later and more important
ones.</p>

<p>But there did not seem much fear of failure with Doris.</p>

<p>Off the stage, and in her dressing room, she was
quiet and subdued, but the moment she got on the
boards her eyes flew to the centre box, and she seemed
to draw inspiration from the handsome face that leaned
forward in rapt, almost devout, attention.</p>

<p>The play proceeded. The great scene, in which Romeo
takes leave of Juliet, his newly-made wife, went with
a rush. The audience cheered until it was hoarse. Thrice
the young actress was called to the front, and everybody
who had brought a bouquet flung it at her feet.</p>

<p>Jeffrey, pale and statuesque, implored Doris to be
calm.</p>

<p>“It is not all over yet!” he said, warningly. “There is
the last scene. Remember what I taught you! It is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
last scene in which a Juliet, who is a Juliet, declares herself!
Do not let their applause make you forget what
is due to your art! I would rather that they remained
mute and silent, Doris.”</p>

<p>And for answer she simply smiled. She did not tell
him that while she could see a certain face in the centre
box all would be well.</p>

<p>The pause before the last scene arrived. The whole
house was talking in excited whispers. To the Barton
folk, ardent theatre-goers as they were, nothing like this
had befallen them. A twitter of excitement ran through
the house, and amongst the crowd that thronged the lobbies
Lord Cecil walked about, as excited as the rest.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if he had been stricken by an idea, he
turned up the collar of his coat and made his way
through the press to the streets, and looked about him
eagerly.</p>

<p>Some women selling oranges came hurrying up to
him, and amongst them a woman with a basket of
violets.</p>

<p>He bought the whole contents of her basket, and bade
her tie them together; then, with the flowers in his hand,
he went back to the theatre; but, instead of going to his
box, he made his way to the stalls and stood close to the
orchestra.</p>

<p>The last scene came on. Again it is unnecessary to
describe it; the grim and solemn vault, the beautiful
figure of the girl in the death throes, the terrible agony
of Romeo, were all here, rendered real and lifelike by the
genius of the actors.</p>

<p>Spellbound, the house watched and listened in profound
silence. Listened to the passionate, despairing
plaint of Romeo, and the deeper agony of Juliet, who
awakes to find her lover dead.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, since the play was played, was actress
more touching, more tear-compelling than Doris Marlowe
that night at the Theatre Royal, Barton; and as her
last words died away in solemn silence, a great sob
seemed to rise from the crowded house.</p>

<p>Then the sob gave place to a thunder of applause.
Once more the sober audience seemed possessed by a
spirit of delirium; men sprang to their feet and waved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
their hats, women rose and waved their handkerchiefs
with which they had wiped away their tears; and cries of
“Juliet! Juliet!” resounded through the theatre.</p>

<p>A pause, and presently Romeo appeared, leading Juliet
by the hand.</p>

<p>The audience stormed and cheered as one man, and
those who had not already thrown their bouquets to her
threw them now.</p>

<p>She was pale to the lips, and the blue eyes looked almost
black as she bent them on the cheering crowd, and
like a queen bowed beneath the tribute of their devotion,
she bent her girlish head low.</p>

<p>She had nearly crossed the stage, had reached the spot
exactly opposite that on which Lord Cecil stood. Then,
and not till then, he raised his bunch of violets and tossed
them at her feet.</p>

<p>She paused a moment in her triumphant progress, for
it was nothing less, then stooped and picked up the
rough-and-ready bouquet; Romeo’s arms were quite full.</p>

<p>For an instant her eyes rested on Lord Cecil’s face,
then, as if with an involuntary movement, she raised the
bunch of violets to her lips and passed off, the side wings
engulfing her.</p>

<p>Three times more they called her, as if they could
not let her go from their sight, and thrice she came before
them, and, modestly, girlishly, bowed her acknowledgments.</p>

<p>Then—tired, hot and thirsty—the crowd began to disperse.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil Neville alone remained on the spot from
which he had thrown his bouquet. He could scarcely believe
that it was over, until the attendants began to cover
up the seats with their calico wrappings, and, taking the
hint, he made his way out.</p>

<p>The groups of people he passed through were talking
about her triumph. He caught a word here and there,
and, all unconsciously, found himself at the stage door.
At least, he thought, he should get a glimpse of her as
she drove away from the theatre.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, behind the scenes the greatest excitement
prevailed. There had never been a Juliet like her, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
were declaring; and they prophesied a success in London
which should even eclipse that of Barton!</p>

<p>And Doris, looking pale, stood smiling dreamily
through it all. Even while Jeffrey paced to and fro in
her dressing-room, too excited for speech, she remained
calm and serene, wrapt in a kind of spiritual veil.</p>

<p>Managers, actors, thronged round her with congratulations;
even the old dresser, declared, with tears, that
“nothing had been seen like it.”</p>

<p>At last, the porter announced that Miss Marlowe’s fly
was waiting, and Jeffrey took her away from the excited
crowd.</p>

<p>“Draw your cloak well round your throat,” he said, as
anxiously as if she were so fragile that a breath of wind
would sweep her away. “Give me those violets to hold
for you,” he said.</p>

<p>She drew her hand back, almost with a gesture of
dread, and a dash of color came flying into her pale face.</p>

<p>“No, no—I can manage, thanks,” she said, quickly.
“How sweet they smell, do they not?” and she held them
up to him for a second.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, absently. “Were they thrown with the
rest?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Some one of the poor people in the pit, I daresay,”
he said; “a graceful and spontaneous tribute, worth, I
was going to say, all the rest of them, beautiful and
costly though some of the bouquets are. But I daresay
you don’t agree with me?” and he smiled.</p>

<p>“But I do,” she said, averting her eyes. “Yes, I think
them worth all the rest!”</p>

<p>They had traversed the long passage by this time, and
reached the fly. Jeffrey put her in carefully, and was
himself following, when he stopped suddenly, frowning
and biting his lips.</p>

<p>“Doris,” he said, “you leave all to me? You leave all
to my judgment, as hitherto? You are a famous woman
now, or will be to-morrow, and may like to be independent.
Would you rather wait till to-morrow and make
your own arrangements with the manager, or shall I,
as of old——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“Jeffrey!” she broke in, with a reproachful look in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said. “Brown has made me a very
large offer for a month. I put him off just now, but I
think I will go back and accept for you. I shall not be
many minutes.”</p>

<p>Doris leaned back, and, closing her eyes, pressed the
violets against her cheek. She could see the handsome
face all aglow with excitement and admiration as he
raised his right arm and flung the flowers; she could see
it at that moment, and the mental vision shut out all the
rest of that eventful night.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard her name spoken beside the carriage
window, and, leaning forward, she saw, in real
earnest, the face which had been her inspiration. It was
Lord Cecil Neville’s.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe,” he said, learning forward and speaking
quietly, pleadingly. “Don’t be angry! Pray forgive
me! I—I could not pass on without saying a word—one
word of thanks.”</p>

<p>“Thanks?” she murmured.</p>

<p>Her eyes were lifted for a moment to his ardent face,
then dropped to the violets and rested there.</p>

<p>“Yes. I was in the theatre,” he said. “You did not
see me, of course, but I was there, and—I can’t tell you
how we all felt, how we all feel. It was superb; it was—but
there, I can only thank you.”</p>

<p>“You have done that already,” she said, with a smile,
as she raised the violets.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil Neville blushed. I am afraid it would be
rather difficult to get credit for this statement in certain
quarters in London.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get any better ones,” he said, apologetically.</p>

<p>“No,” she said; “I think you could not! Yes, I saw
you in the theatre,” she added, as if she had been thinking
of his first sentence. “Were—were you surprised, or
did you know?” and she glanced at him with a half curious
smile.</p>

<p>“Surprised!” he said. “I could scarcely believe my
senses! I had no idea, until I saw you on the stage, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
you, who were so good to me yesterday, were a great
actress.”</p>

<p>“I am not,” she said, in a low voice. “I am only a
very little one. To-night I succeeded, another night I
might fail——” a faint shadow came on her face, as he
looked puzzled; then she smiled, as she broke off, to
add: “I have something of yours——”</p>

<p>“Yes, my heart!” was his mental comment, but he said
aloud: “Of mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “A handkerchief, I haven’t it here,”
and she smiled again; then, suddenly, her face grew crimson,
for she remembered that she had left it in the bosom
of her dress. “I—I will send it to you if you tell me
where.”</p>

<p>“Let me call for it,” he said, eagerly.</p>

<p>Doris’ brows came together, and she shook her head
gently. She knew that Jeffrey’s welcome to a stranger
would be a rough one.</p>

<p>“I will send it,” she said. “I think I know—the
Towers, you said, did you not?”</p>

<p>A sudden inspiration seized him, and, bending forward,
he said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>“If you should walk in the fields to-morrow morning—you
may, you know!—lay it on the bank where you sat
yesterday. Will you do this, Miss Marlowe? I will fetch
it in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>The beautiful eyes dwelt upon his face with a deep
gravity for a moment, as if she were wondering what his
object could be in making the request; then she said,
gently:</p>

<p>“Yes, why should I not?” as she held out her hand;
“good-night.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, thanks!” he said, in his deep, musical voice.
“Good-night! You should be happy to-night, for you
have made so many people miserably so! I shall dream
of Juliet all night!”</p>

<p>She let her hand rest in his for a moment, then drew
it away and he was gone.</p>

<p>But at that moment it chanced that a handsomely-appointed
carriage came round the bend of the road, and
a lady, with softly-shimmering hair and darkly-brilliant
eyes, who was leaning back in a corner of it, suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
caught sight of the fly and the stalwart figure standing
beside it.</p>

<p>She bent forward eagerly, and her keen eyes took in,
as the carriage rolled past, not only the expression of
Cecil Neville’s face, but the face of the girl in the fly.</p>

<p>For an instant the warm blood rushed to Lady Grace’s
face; then, as she sank back again into her corner, she
laughed, a laugh of cold, insolent contempt.</p>

<p>“Some actress or shop-girl,” she murmured. Then her
expression changed, and she bit her lip thoughtfully.
“And yet he looked terribly in earnest!” she added.
“Shall I take him up?” and her hand went out to the
check-string; then she let it fall, and the carriage go on
its way. “No; I think I’ll keep my little discovery to
myself—it may be useful—and let you walk home, Lord
Cecil!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A RARE DIAMOND.</p>


<p>When Doris came down from her room the next morning,
it did not seem as if the tremendous excitement of the
preceding night had left any baleful effects. In her soft-white
dress, she still looked more like a schoolgirl home
for the holidays than the tragedienne who had, a few
hours ago, moved a vast audience to tears and wild enthusiasm.</p>

<p>She came into the room singing, just as the birds sang
under the eaves by her window, and laughed lightly as
she saw Jeffrey bending earnestly over a copy of the local
daily paper.</p>

<p>“Well, have I got a tremendous slating, Jeffrey?” she
said, almost carelessly.</p>

<p>“Slating!” he replied. “If anything, it is too laudatory;
read it!” and he held it out to her.</p>

<p>“After breakfast; I am so hungry,” she said, contentedly.
“Read it to me, Jeffrey; all the nicest paragraphs,”
and she laughed again.</p>

<p>He glanced at Doris under his heavy brows.</p>

<p>“At any rate, your success has not made you vain,
Doris,” he said with grim approval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“If it should make any one vain, it should you—not
me, dear,” she said, quietly. “It was you made last
night’s Juliet, good or bad.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said; “I’ll be vain for both of us.
Yes, it is a wonderfully good <i>critique</i>, and I think the
news of your success will reach London, too. There were
a couple of critics from London in the stalls; I didn’t tell
you last night, in case it should make you nervous.”</p>

<p>She looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would have made much difference,”
she said. “I seemed to forget everybody and everything——”</p>

<p>“After the second act,” he put in.</p>

<p>She blushed to her temples.</p>

<p>“There was a distinct change, then; I noticed it, and I
have been puzzling my brain to account for it. Perhaps
you can explain it.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and kept her eyes on her plate.</p>

<p>“No? Strange. But such inspirations are not uncommon
with genius; and yours is genius, Doris.”</p>

<p>“Don’t frighten me, Jeffrey,” she said, with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>“I have agreed with Brown, the manager,” he went on,
“that you should play Juliet for a week, and after that
some other of the big characters for a month, and he is
to pay you ten pounds a week.”</p>

<p>Doris looked up, surprised. Ten pounds per week is a
large sum for merely provincial actresses.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“You think it a great deal? In a day or two you will
get offers from London of twenty, thirty, forty pounds.
But I am in no hurry. I have not been in a hurry all
through. I want you to feel your feet, to feel secure in
all the big parts here in the provinces before you appear
in London. Then your success will be assured whatever
you may undertake.”</p>

<p>“You think of everything, Jeffrey,” she said, gratefully.</p>

<p>“I have nothing else to think of, nothing else to tell
you!” he responded, quietly, almost pathetically. “I
have set my heart upon you being a great actress and”—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
paused—“I think it would break, if you failed. But
there is no need to speak of failure after last night.”</p>

<p>He got up as he spoke and folded the newspaper.</p>

<p>“I’m going down to the theatre,” he said; he was never
quite contented away from it. “You’d better look over
your part this morning. Take it into the open air as
you did the other day; it seems to succeed.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said, obediently.</p>

<p>He put on his hat and the thick inverness he wore in all
weathers, and went away, and Doris sat looking dreamily
before her.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, she got up. She would take his advice
and go into the meadows—for the meadows meant
the open air to her—and as she was going she would take
Cecil Neville’s handkerchief and place it on the bank as
he had requested.</p>

<p>She put on her hat and jacket, and, possibly for the
convenience of carrying, thrust the handkerchief in the
bosom of her dress, where it lay hidden all the preceding
day, and started.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning, with only a feather of cloud
here and there in the sky, and the birds sang as if winter
were an unknown season in England.</p>

<p>With her stage copy of “Romeo and Juliet” under her
arm, Doris Marlowe, the simple child of nature, the
famous actress, made her way to the meadows.</p>

<p>The Barton folks have something else to do than wander
in their meadows, and Doris did not meet a soul; the
great elms, which threw their shadows over the brook,
were as solitary as if they had been planted in Eden. But
lonely as the spot was, Doris peopled it with memories;
and she stood by the brook and recalled the vision of the
powerful figure on the great horse, as it appeared before
her the moment prior to its being hurled at her feet.</p>

<p>“How strange that he should have been at the theatre
last night!” she thought. “How curious it must have
seemed to him, seeing me there as Juliet! I wonder
whether he was sorry or glad!”</p>

<p>She could not answer the question to her satisfaction,
but she stood motionless for a moment or two, recalling
the words he had spoken as he stood beside the fly last
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Then she took the handkerchief from her bosom, and,
folding it with careful neatness, placed it on the bank
where she had sat.</p>

<p>“It is not likely that any one will come here before he
comes to fetch it this afternoon,” she said.</p>

<p>Almost before the words were out of her lips a stalwart
form leaped the hedge, and stood before her.</p>

<p>Doris started and her face flushed; then, pale and composed,
she lifted her eyes to his.</p>

<p>“Well, now!” he said, in humble apology, “I seem fated
to startle you, Miss Marlowe. I had no idea you were
here——” he stopped, awed to silence by her silence.</p>

<p>“You said you would come for it in the afternoon,” she
remarked, almost coldly.</p>

<p>He colored.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; but I could not come this afternoon, and
I thought——” he stopped, and raised his frank eyes to
her face, pleadingly.</p>

<p>“You thought?” she said very gravely, her brows drawn
together slightly.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, as if with an effort, “I will tell the
truth! I thought that if I came this morning I might
meet you. It was just a chance. Are you angry?”</p>

<p>She was silent a moment. Was she angry? She felt
that she ought to be; and had a suspicion that he had, so
to speak, entrapped her into a meeting with him; and she
honestly tried to be angry.</p>

<p>“It does not matter,” she said, at last, very coldly.
“There is your handkerchief.”</p>

<p>He picked it up, and thrust it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you!” he said, gratefully. She
turned to go, with a slight inclination of her head, but
he went on, speaking hurriedly and so earnestly, that she
paused, her head half turned over her shoulder, her eyes
cast down; an attitude so full of grace that it almost drove
what he was going to say out of his head. “I don’t deserve
that you should have brought it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you do,” she assented, a faint smile curving
her lips at his ingenuousness.</p>

<p>“I daresay you think it strange that I didn’t ask you
to send it to the Towers?” he went on. “You know you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
would not let me call at your place for it,” he added, apologetically.</p>

<p>“Why did you not let me send it?” she asked, with
faint curiosity.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” he said. “Won’t you sit down
and rest? It’s warm this morning, and you have walked
far, perhaps.”</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, then sat down, almost on the
spot she had sat the preceding day, and Cecil Neville
could not help a wild wish rushing to his heart that he
was once again lying at her feet!</p>

<p>He sat down on the bank, as near to her as he dared,
and leaned on his elbow toward her.</p>

<p>“You see, I’m only a visitor at the Towers. The marquis—that’s
my uncle, you know——”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said, with a faint smile, her eyes
fixed dreamily on her book.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” he assented. “Well, we don’t get on
together. He is—not to put too fine a point on it—about
as disagreeable a person as you’d find in two days’ walk!
We never have got on together. They say that a man
always hates the fellow who is to come after him, unless it
happens to be his own son; and I suppose that’s the reason
the marquis hates me——”</p>

<p>“Because you are to be the next marquis?” she said.</p>

<p>He nodded coolly, and tilted his hat so that it screened
his eyes from the sun, and permitted him to feast upon her
beautiful face more completely.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is about it; but I’ll give the marquis the
credit of hating everybody all round, himself into the
bargain, I dare say; but I fancy he reserves a special line
of detestation for his own relatives. Ah, you are smiling,”
he broke off, with the short laugh that sounded so
good and frank. “You are wondering what this has to
do with my disliking you to send the handkerchief!”</p>

<p>Doris smiled again in assent.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I thought it might come into the marquis’s
possession, or that he’d hear of it through Lady
Grace——”</p>

<p>She turned her eyes upon his, not curiously, but with
graceful questioning.</p>

<p>“That’s a lady—Lord Peyton’s daughter—who is stopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
there,” he explained, “and they might ask questions,
and—and bother me about it!”</p>

<p>“Well?” she said, quietly.</p>

<p>He looked down half hesitatingly, then met her eyes,
which seemed in their fixed regard to reach to his soul.</p>

<p>“Well—I’ve said that I’ll tell you the whole truth, and
I will; and the fact is I didn’t want to be asked questions
about the—the accident yesterday. I—yes, I’ll speak out,
though I should offend you—I wanted to keep it to myself!”</p>

<p>“To keep it to yourself?” she repeated.</p>

<p>A flush came to his tanned face, and his eyes were
raised for a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes. When a man gets a good thing—Suppose—”
he broke off—“a fellow found a big nugget, or a rare
diamond, or anything of that sort, he would like to keep it
to himself, you know!”</p>

<p>She smiled again.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to take that as a compliment?” she
said. “Am I the big nugget, the rare diamond which
you discovered?”</p>

<p>He flushed more deeply, and looked at her pleadingly.</p>

<p>“I’m such an idiot that I can’t express myself,” he said,
apologetically. “I meant that the whole thing, your—your
kindness and goodness to me was so precious that I
didn’t want a lot of people talking about it. I wanted to
keep it to myself, as something especially belonging to me,
something too precious to discuss with others. I’m afraid
I can’t make you understand.”</p>

<p>“You do yourself an injustice,” she said. “You express
yourself very well!”</p>

<p>“Now, you are laughing at me,” he said.</p>

<p>“As you would laugh at me, Lord Neville, if I believed
what you said!” she retorted, not sharply, but with a
sweet gravity that was indescribable.</p>

<p>“I said I would tell you the truth, and I’ve told nothing
but the truth,” he said, earnestly. “I dare say it
seems strange to you that I should have this feeling about
our meeting yesterday. I dare say you forgot all about it
half-an-hour afterward! Why should you remember it,
you who have so much to think of?”</p>

<p>Doris turned her face away, lest her eyes should betray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
her, and tell him how much, how constantly she had
thought of him!</p>

<p>“You,” he went on, “who are so clever and gifted, a
great actress, with no end of people round you——”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a pensive smile.</p>

<p>“But you are wrong, quite wrong,” she said. “I am
not a great actress. Last night was my first success, if
success it was——”</p>

<p>“There is no ‘if’ about it!” he said, with fervent enthusiasm.
“It was a tremendous success! Why, I heard
people declare that there had been nothing like it since
Kate Terry’s Juliet! And I—though I’m not of much
account—I was never so much carried out of myself.
Why, to tell you how great and grand you were, I actually
forgot that you were the young lady who was so good to
me yesterday, and only thought of you as Shakespeare’s
Juliet; and I felt quite ashamed that I had ever given
so much trouble to so great a personage.”</p>

<p>His warm, ardent praise touched her, and her lips
quivered.</p>

<p>“Juliet was only a simple girl, after all,” she said. “If
she had chanced to have been placed in my position yesterday
she would have done the same.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” he said. “I’m not clever,
like you,” and he pushed his hat off his brows with a deprecatory
gesture. “But I know you must have something
else to think of than the fellow who was such an
idiot as to jump a hedge before he saw what was on the
other side; and, of course, you must have no end of—of
people round you!”</p>

<p>“But I have not! You are quite wrong,” she said, with
her sweet, thoughtful smile. “I live with an old friend,
who has been like a father to me! I haven’t any father
or mother, and I see no one, except at the theatre, and
then only in the way of business,” and she laughed.</p>

<p>He listened as if every word she dropped from her
sweetly-curved lips were a pearl.</p>

<p>“How strange it sounds! You so clever and beau——so
great an actress.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said dreamily; “I suppose it does sound
strange! Everybody thinks that an actress must be the
gayest of the gay; surrounded by light-hearted people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
turning night into day, and living on champagne and
roast chicken.” She smiled. “Jeffrey and I know
scarcely any one, and I do not think I have tasted champagne,
excepting once, when one of the managers had a
benefit; and we go straight to bed directly we get home
from the theatre; and, oh, it is quite different to what
people imagine.”</p>

<p>He drew forward a little, so that the hand upon which
he leaned touched the edge of her cotton dress.</p>

<p>“And—and you didn’t quite forget our strange meeting?”</p>

<p>“I am not in the habit of seeing gentlemen flung from
their horses at my feet, Lord Neville,” she said, but she
turned her face from him.</p>

<p>“And I,” he said. “Why, I have not been able to get
it out of my head! I thought of you every minute; and
I tried not to, because——”</p>

<p>“Because?” she said. “Pray go on!” and she smiled.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, modestly, “because it seemed like presumption.
And then I went to the theatre, and——” he
stopped. “For a moment or two I couldn’t believe that
it was really you on the stage there. And when the people
in the theatre began to shout out your name, it woke
me from a kind of dream.”</p>

<p>She smiled in silence; then she made a movement
threatening her departure.</p>

<p>“Ah, wait a little while!” he pleaded. “It is delightful
here in the sunshine. Don’t go for a minute or two.
I wish——” he stopped.</p>

<p>“What is it you wish?” she asked, regarding him with
smiling eyes that drooped under his ardent ones.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I wish that you would let me go
home with you and see Mr. Jeffrey——”</p>

<p>“Jeffrey Flint,” she said. She shook her head. “He
sees no one, makes no acquaintances. He—he is very reserved.”</p>

<p>Speaking of him reminded her of the fact that he would
strongly disapprove of her interview with this strange
young gentleman. She rose.</p>

<p>“I must go now,” she said. “I have not asked whether
you were hurt by your fall, Lord Neville, but I hope you
were not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“Must you go?” he said, ignoring the rest of her sentence
as of no account. “We seem to have been talking
only a few minutes! And there was such a lot that I
wanted to say! I wanted to tell you all that I thought
when I saw you last night; but I couldn’t if I had the
chance, because I am a perfect idiot when it comes to
expressing myself. But I do think it was wonderful!
Are you going to play to-night? But of course you are.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, absently, “I play to-night. I play
every night!”</p>

<p>“I shall be there,” he said, as if it were a matter of
course.</p>

<p>She looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Of course I shall!” he said. “Why, last night I
seemed to have a kind of interest in it which the other
people in the theatre hadn’t. Yes. As if—as if—I knew
you intimately, you know. Of course, I shall be there!
And I shall bring a big bouquet. What flowers do you
like best?”</p>

<p>She almost started, as if she had not been listening
to him; as a matter of fact, she had been listening to the
deep, measured voice rather than the words.</p>

<p>“Flowers?—oh—violets,” she said, unthinkingly.</p>

<p>“Why!” he exclaimed. “That is what I threw you last
night! Of course, you didn’t know. You can’t see beyond
the footlights, can you? I’ve heard you can’t. Violets!
I’ll get some. I shall take a seat in the stall to-night.
I shall see and hear you better there.”</p>

<p>“I should have thought you had seen and heard me
enough already,” she said with a smile.</p>

<p>“No, but I haven’t!” he responded, eagerly. “I couldn’t
see you or hear you too much if I looked at you and
listened to you all day!”</p>

<p>Her face grew crimson, but she turned her head toward
him with a smile on her face.</p>

<p>“For flattery, pure and simple, I don’t think you could
surpass that, Lord Neville.”</p>

<p>“Flattery!” he exclaimed, as if hurt. “It is no flattery,
it is the honest truth. And, Miss Marlowe, I do not ask
you to believe—” he saw her start and lift her head as
if listening, and looking up to ascertain the cause, saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
that her eyes were fixed upon some spot behind him,
and he heard the sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>“I must go,” she said, as if suddenly awakened to a
sense of the situation.</p>

<p>“Ah, no,” he breathed; then he leaned toward her with
half-timid eagerness. “Will you come to-morrow?”</p>

<p>The footsteps came nearer.</p>

<p>“I promise—nothing,” said Doris, her brows coming
together, and with a half glance at his earnest face she
glided away from him.</p>

<p>Lord Neville rose and looked after her with the expression
which encompassed the desire to follow her;
but in that moment a hand fell lightly upon his shoulder,
and a voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What, Cissy!”</p>

<p>Lord Neville swung round.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Spenser!” he said. “Why, what on earth
brought you here?”</p>

<p class="center">SPENSER CHURCHILL.</p>


<p>The new comer was a man apparently of middle age;
I say apparently, because opinions on that subject were
extremely conflicting. Some persons regarded Spenser
Churchill as quite a young man, others declared that he
had reached the meridian of life, and there were some
who were inclined to think that he was, if anything, on
the verge of old age. His appearance was singular. He
was of medium height, with a figure that was either
naturally youthful, or admirably preserved. He was fair
almost to effeminacy, and he wore his hair long and
brushed back from his face; and he was close shaven.
But it was not the length of the hair that lent him his
singularity, but the expression of his face and his manner.</p>

<p>If he was not the most amiable of men, his countenance
belied him. There was always a smile, soft and
bland, and good-tempered in his eyes, on his lips, and as
the Irishman said, “all over him.” The smile, in conjunction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
with the fair face and long hair, gave him as
confiding and benevolent an expression that the world
had long ago come to the conclusion that Spenser
Churchill was the epitome of all the virtues.</p>

<p>Most women were fond of confiding in him; most men—not
all—trusted him; he was regarded by crossing-sweepers,
waiters and beggars generally as their natural
prey, and so effective was his smile, that even when he
did not bestow his alms, he always received a blessing
from the disappointed ones.</p>

<p>Whenever his name was mentioned, some one was
sure to say:</p>

<p>“Oh, Spenser Churchill! Yes! Awfully good-natured
fellow, you know. No end of a good soul. Share his
last crust with you. Kind of cherub with legs, don’t you
know.”</p>

<p>But, if strict inquiry had been made—which it never
was—it would have been difficult to bring forward evidence
to prove the benevolent Spenser had ever shared
anything with anybody, or that he had ever been liberal
with anything, excepting always the smile and his soft
persuasive voice.</p>

<p>Of his past history, and, indeed, his present mode of
life, the persons who were always ready to praise him
knew very little—or nothing, and yet he was always
spoken of as one of the best known men in society.</p>

<p>You met him everywhere; at the first reception of the
season, at the meeting of the Four-in-Hand Club, at the
smoking-room of the “Midnight,” sauntering in the foyer
at the opera, seated in the stalls of the fashionable theatres,
in county houses of the most exclusive kinds, on
the shady side of Pall Mall, in the picture galleries, at
the big concerts, at dinner parties. His neat figure
always most carefully dressed, his countenance always
serene and placid, as if the world were the most charming
of all possible places, and had been specially created for
Spenser Churchill; and with the benedictory smile always
shining.</p>

<p>He was rich, it was supposed; he was a bachelor, it
was thought; he was connected with half the peerage, so
it was stated; and that was all concerning his private
life that any one knew. But, if little was known about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
him, Spenser Churchill knew a great deal about other
people; some said, too much.</p>

<p>Lord Neville’s surprise at seeing him was quite uncalled
for, because Spenser Churchill was in the habit of
“turning up” at the most unlikely places, and at the
most unlikely times; and whatever surprise you might
feel at seeing him, he never expressed any at meeting
you.</p>

<p>Now, as Lord Neville stared at him, he blandly and
placidly smiled, as if he had parted from Neville only a
quarter-of-an-hour ago, and held out his hand as if he
were bestowing a bishopric by the action.</p>

<p>“Why, the last time I saw you was at Nice!” said
Lord Neville, with a laugh, “and here you are at Barton!
What on earth brings you here? Don’t make the
usual answer about the two-twenty-five train and your
legs——”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking of doing so,” said Spenser Churchill,
softly. “What a charming spot!” and he looked round
with a soft rapture beaming on his face. “Charming!
So rural! That brook—those trees—the clear, spring sky—the
songs of the birds—didn’t I hear human voices, by
the way?” he asked; and it is to be noticed that he didn’t
break off to put the question abruptly, but allowed it
to form portions of his softly-gliding sentence, as if it
were the most innocent and careless of queries, and he
let his eyes fall with a gentle, beaming interrogation on
the handsome face.</p>

<p>Lord Neville looked aside for a moment. Cherubimic
as Spenser Churchill was, Lord Neville did not quite care
to answer the question.</p>

<p>“I daresay,” he said; “but you haven’t answered me
yet, Spenser. What brings you here?”</p>

<p>“A deeply-rooted love of the country, my dear Cissy;
from a child I have reveled in—er—the green meadows
and the purling brook. I always fly from town at every
opportunity. And you?”</p>

<p>“I am staying at Barton,” said Cecil Neville, rather
shortly.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill raised his pale eyebrows with a faint
surprise.</p>

<p>“With the marquis—with the uncle?” he said, softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Exactly. You are surprised; so was I when I got
the invitation.”</p>

<p>“No, really? Ah, I am so glad! It is so nice to see
relations living together in harmony——”</p>

<p>“But we don’t live in harmony!” broke in Neville, in
his impetuous fashion. “We have only met once or twice
and have nearly quarreled on each occasion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, I don’t think the dear marquis could quarrel
with you, his nephew.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re right,” said Neville, with a rather grim
laugh. “The dear marquis doesn’t quarrel, he’s too
highly polished to do anything so vulgar; he only carries
on until one is driven half mad by the longing to
pitch him out of the window——”</p>

<p>“My dear Neville! Always the same wild recklessness.
Pitch the marquis out of the window!” and Spenser
Churchill laughed—a kind of dove-like coo. “Now,
that is strange! I always find the marquis so delightfully
charming——”</p>

<p>“But so you do everybody,” retorted Lord Neville,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, most people are, aren’t they?” said Spenser
Churchill, blandly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Lord Neville. “I’m afraid I
must be getting back. I’m due at lunch.” He pulled out
his watch, but instead of looking at it, glanced in the
direction Doris had taken.</p>

<p>“Looking for any one?” inquired Spenser, softly.</p>

<p>Lord Neville started rather impatiently.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “oh, no. Where are you staying? I’ll
look you up——”</p>

<p>“I’ll come with you,” said Spenser. “The walk will
be delightful, and I am glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“All right, come on then,” said Lord Neville, and the
two started in the direction of the Towers.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill did most of the talking—it was almost
like singing, so soft and bland and unobtrusive was
the voice; Lord Neville listening rather absently, and
making answers rather wide of the mark at times—for
he was thinking of Doris—and when they reached the
entrance to the avenue he stopped.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I can’t take upon myself to ask you in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
to lunch, Spenser,” he said, with a laugh; “but my uncle
might—and probably would—consider it a liberty, and
have you, possibly both of us, chucked out; and, though
I shouldn’t mind it, you mightn’t like it, you know.”</p>

<p>“I really think I’ll take the risk” said Spenser. “The
marquis and I are such old friends, that I—yes, I’ll
chance being expelled.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Lord Neville, as before. “Come
on, then; and don’t blame me if the consequences are
as I suggested.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t blame you,” said Spenser Churchill.</p>

<p>They made their way to the hall, and the groom of
the chambers and the footmen received them as if they
were royal visitors.</p>

<p>Lord Neville said:</p>

<p>“Tell the marquis that Mr. Spenser Churchill has arrived,
please.”</p>

<p>The groom did not look surprised, but merely bowed
as he departed.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was empty, and the two men stood
talking for a minute; then the groom came and led Mr.
Spenser Churchill to wash his hands, and Lord Neville
went up to his room. As he came down the luncheon
bell rang, and he led Spenser Churchill into the dining-room.</p>

<p>The marquis was already seated, and Lord Neville
was about to explain Spenser’s presence, when he saw
the marquis give a start, and as he rose and extended
his hand, Neville fancied that he noticed a peculiar twitch
of the thin, colorless lips.</p>

<p>“Ah! Spenser,” said his lordship, and he spoke, Lord
Neville thought, with something less than his usual cold
and biting hauteur, “this is a surprise! Pray be seated,”
and he himself sank into his chair, with no trace of the
mental disturbance in his face or manner, if there had,
indeed, been any.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a surprise,” said Spenser Churchill, softly,
taking his seat, and unfolding his napkin, as if he had
been lunching at the same table for months past; “I was
so fortunate as to meet our dear Neville in the—er—fields,
I may say, where he was roaming in happy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
poetic solitude, and he was kind enough to assure me
of a welcome if I came on with him.”</p>

<p>“His assurance was—on this occasion—justified,” said
the marquis, with a cold glance at the young man.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill smiled, as if the taunting and exasperating
speech were one of the most amiable.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he murmured; “and you are well, I hope,
marquis?”</p>

<p>“I am never ill,” replied his lordship, as if he were
quite incapable of such vulgarity.</p>

<p>“Ah, no, that is always so delightful of you!” said
Spenser. “Our dear Neville enjoys the famous Stoyle
constitution also; he is never ill, are you, Neville?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Neville, grimly, and without lifting his
eyes from his plate.</p>

<p>“I have always been given to understand that the
possession of rude health is the privilege of the fool,” remarked
the marquis. “Of course, we are the exceptions
from the rule.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” murmured Spenser again, as if this were
the most charming of compliments. “Some of us, alas,
have become convinced that we have hearts and livers!”</p>

<p>“Not all of us—so far as the hearts are concerned,”
said Neville, curtly.</p>

<p>The marquis almost smiled; to goad any one into a
retort made him as nearly happy as it was possible for
him to be.</p>

<p>“Where are you staying? You will come on here, of
course?” he said.</p>

<p>“I am staying at the hotel at Barton. I think they
call it the ‘Royal.’ It would be quite too charming if it
did not smell so strongly of stale tobacco and coffee.
Thanks, yes, I shall be very glad.”</p>

<p>The marquis looked at the butler, the look meaning:
“Send for Mr. Spenser Churchill’s luggage.” The butler
glided from the room.</p>

<p>“You find us quite a merry party,” said the marquis.
“We have another visitor besides Neville——”</p>

<p>“Who can scarcely be counted a visitor,” murmured
Spenser.</p>

<p>“Really, that is scarcely fair,” said the marquis, blandly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
“Neville has his faults, but he is not quite the
nonentity you would represent him.”</p>

<p>Neville raised his head, stung to a retort, when the
door opposite him opened and Lady Grace entered.</p>

<p>She was charming, perfectly dressed, looking like a
vision of one of Lippo Lippi’s angels.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m late——” she began, lightly, then her
eyes fell upon Spenser’s smiling face, and her own paled.
For a second she stood still and put out her hand as if
seeking something to support her, then her face resumed
its usual serenity, and with a smile she came
forward.</p>

<p>“Mr. Spenser Churchill! Really! What a nice surprise!”</p>

<p>“How good, how kind of you to say so!” he sang, as
he bent over her hand.</p>

<p>“I am always good and kind; I can’t help it. Well,
Lord Neville, how have you been amusing yourself?”
she went on, as he rose and arranged her chair for her.</p>

<p>“Under melancholy boughs in the woods, musing in
moody meditation, mentally morbid!” said Spenser
Churchill. “I found him beside a purling brook, composing
sonnets, Lady Grace.”</p>

<p>“Or dreaming of last night’s Juliet?” she said, smiling.</p>

<p>He looked up quickly, but her eyes seemed full of
unconsciousness and innocence.</p>

<p>“You did go to the theatre last night, didn’t you?” she
asked. “They told me so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I went,” he replied.</p>

<p>“And it was ‘Romeo and Juliet,’ wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>She made a little grimace.</p>

<p>“Fancy ‘Romeo and Juliet’ at a country theatre, Mr.
Churchill!—the Romeo striding about, all gasps and
sighs, the Juliet fat, fair and forty! Poor Lord Neville!”
and her silvery laugh rang softly through the room.</p>

<p>Lord Neville knew it would be the better, wiser course
to smile and shrug his shoulders, but he could not.</p>

<p>“It was quite the reverse,” he said, and his voice
sounded short and almost grim. “The play was well
cast, and admirably staged. The Romeo didn’t gasp or
strut, and the Juliet——” he stopped, feeling that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
voice had grown more enthusiastic, and was betraying
his. “Oh! she played very well,” he said.</p>

<p>“Indeed! Really!” exclaimed Lady Grace. “Oughtn’t
we to patronize the local talent, marquis?”</p>

<p>He raised his cold eyes to her lovely face.</p>

<p>“I am too old to commit mental suicide,” he said;
“take Neville’s recommendation, and go, if you like,
and be sorry for it.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“After all, I don’t think I could venture on it; it would
be—forgive me, Lord Neville—too awful. And so you
have come to Barton, Mr. Churchill. And from whence,
pray?”</p>

<p>They talked together in this light, careless, half-indifferent
<i>blasé</i> manner which is now—Heaven help us!—the
fashion; and Lord Neville finished his lunch in silence.</p>

<p>“I promise nothing!” rang in his ears; “I promise
nothing!” It was a strange answer. Most girls would
have said: “Yes,” or glanced at him, so to speak, indignantly;
but, “I promise nothing!” she had said, in her
sweet, grave, penetrating voice. Would she come? And
if she did, how much the happier would it be? What
on earth had come to him, that he should be unable
to think of anything but this lovely, bewitching girl, so
beautiful in face and great in genius?</p>

<p>He woke with a start as the marquis rose, and bowed
to Lady Grace, who was quitting the room.</p>

<p>“Come with me and smoke a cigar,” said Lord Neville
to Spenser Churchill.</p>

<p>“Mr. Churchill will do nothing of the kind,” exclaimed
Lady Grace, stopping and looking over her shoulder, not
at his smiling face, but at the opposite wall. “How inconsiderate
you are, Lord Neville; you forget that I am
dying to hear all the latest news.”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d heard it all,” he said, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Not half!” she retorted. “I shall be on the terrace,
Mr. Churchill.”</p>

<p>He bowed and smiled; then he turned to the marquis.</p>

<p>“There used to be a very fine old port, marquis,” he
said.</p>

<p>The marquis glanced at the butler, who went out, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
returned presently, carefully carrying a bottle in a wicker
frame, and Mr. Spenser Churchill sipped the famous
wine with angelic enjoyment.</p>

<p>“There is nothing like port,” he murmured. “Nothing.
Yes, marquis, you look the picture of health. Ah,
my dear Neville, depend upon it, that the moralists are
right after all, and that, if one would enjoy life at its
fullest, the thing is to be good!” and he smiled beamingly
at the marquis, who had, for a generation, been
called: “Wicked Lord Stoyle.”</p>

<p>Lord Neville glanced at the pale, cold face of his
uncle, expecting some cutting retort, but the marquis
only smiled.</p>

<p>“You were always a moralist, Churchill,” he said.
“But your advice comes rather late for Neville, who has,
I’m afraid, made acquaintance with the prodigal’s husks
pretty often.”</p>

<p>“And now comes back to find the fatted calf killed for
him,” sang Mr. Spenser Churchill, sweetly.</p>

<p>The marquis rose.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me interfere with your port,” he said.</p>

<p>Neville looked after him.</p>

<p>“I think I can stand about another day of this,” he
said, quietly.</p>

<p>“After that you would really not be able to resist the
temptation to throw him out of the window, eh? Fie,
fie, my dear Neville!” murmured Spenser Churchill, with
a smile. “Shall we go and join Lady Grace? She won’t
object to a cigarette, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I never asked her,” he said. “I’ll go
and get some cigars,” and he sprang up and left the
room.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill’s bland smile followed him for a
moment or two, then the expression of his face wholly
changed. His lips seemed to grow rigid, his soft, sleepy
eyes acute, his very cheeks, usually so soft and rotund,
hard and angular; and he sat with his glass held firmly
in his hand, peering thoughtfully at the tablecloth.</p>

<p>Then he rose, and, carefully examining the bottle,
poured the remains of it into his glass, and drank it
slowly and appreciatively, and then stepped through the
open window on to the terrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>A slim and graceful figure leaned against the balustrade.
It was Lady Grace; her hands, clasped together, were
pressed hard against the stone coping, as if they were
trying to force their way through it, and the face she
turned towards him was pale and anxious, the face of
one waiting for the verdict; of one expecting the dread
fiat of a judge.</p>

<p>With a benign smile, more marked than ever, perhaps
intensified by the famous port, he slowly approached
her.</p>

<p>“What an exquisite view,” he said, softly, and extending
his hands as if he were pronouncing a benediction
on the scenery; “now that nature is in her spring-time.
How refreshing, how inspiring, how vernal! I cannot
express to you, Lady Grace, how deeply this beauteous
prospect moves me! One must have a hard and unimpressionable
heart, indeed, who is not moved by such a
landscape as this; so soft, so—er—green——”</p>

<p>Her clasped hands grew together more tightly.</p>

<p>“Why have you come here?” she said, suddenly, in a
strained voice.</p>

<p>He raised his pale eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Here—on the terrace, do you mean, Lady Grace?”
he said, in a voice of an innocent, unsophisticated child;
“surely you forget. You, yourself, asked me!”</p>

<p>“Why have you come here?” she repeated.</p>

<p>Without changing his expression or his attitude of
bland, serene enjoyment, he murmured:</p>

<p>“I came because I thought you wanted me—and
you do!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A SECRET COMPACT.</p>


<p>“I came because I thought you wanted me, and you
do,” said Spenser Churchill, softly.</p>

<p>Lady Grace looked at him, with an expression of dislike
and fear—actual fear. It displayed itself in every
line of the fair, perfectly-formed face, in the expansion of
her clear eyes, in the tight—almost painful—compression
of her slim, white hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“Why do you think so?” she demanded, in a low voice.</p>

<p>He smiled, until it seemed as if he meant it for his only
reply, then he said, in a dulcet voice:</p>

<p>“A little bird whispered——”</p>

<p>She made a movement of impatience.</p>

<p>“Is there anything you do not know? Is there anything
one does or says that does not reach you?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, not cynically, but still with
the amused gesture with which one meets the petulance of
a spoiled child.</p>

<p>“I believe there is no secret in any of the lives of the
men and women who call you friend—friend!—that you
have not become possessed of. How is a mystery!”</p>

<p>“It is a question of sympathy, my dear Lady Grace,” he
said. “Nature bestowed upon me a large and sympathetic
heart——”</p>

<p>Again she made a movement of impatience.</p>

<p>“Spare yourself the trouble of trying to delude me!”
she said, in a kind of quiet despair. “There are many
who fully believe you to be what your face, and voice,
and manner, and reputation make you appear, but I am
not one of them—I think I have known you from the
first.”</p>

<p>“You have such keen penetration,” he murmured, as if
she had paid him a delicate compliment.</p>

<p>“I see you without your mask—that mask which presents
the appearance of a smiling, benevolent goodwill!
You cannot impose upon me, Spenser Churchill!”</p>

<p>“Do me the credit of admitting, dear lady, that I never
tried,” he said, softly.</p>

<p>“No,” she said; “it would have been useless. Others
you may deceive; me you cannot. Therefore, I ask you
plainly, why you came here? Of course, I know that you
were aware I was here!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I was aware of it,” he admitted; “but think,
dear Lady Grace, such knowledge does not prove much
astuteness on my part. Lady Grace Peyton’s movements
are one of the social events which are duly reported——”</p>

<p>“None of the papers said that I was at Barton Towers,”
she said, sharply; “you got your information from some
other source!”</p>

<p>“What does it matter?” he remarked, soothingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“No,” she said; “it does not matter, excepting that it
proves what I say, that there is nothing you do not know.
And now, once more, why have you come? I put a plain
question. I expect a plain answer.”</p>

<p>“If we always got what we expected!” he murmured,
mockingly.</p>

<p>She colored and bit her lip.</p>

<p>“You do not mean to answer? It was from no love for
or goodwill to me. I know you do not—like me, Spenser
Churchill!”</p>

<p>He looked quite shocked, and whispered:</p>

<p>“My dear Lady Grace, you hurt me; you do, indeed!
There is no one in the charming circle to which you belong
whom I more ardently admire and respect! Oh,
really, you wound me! Not like you!”—he held out his
soft, plump hands reproachfully—“Lady Grace Peyton
possesses the whole of my esteem; and if I could do her
a service——”</p>

<p>“You would do it!” she broke in, abruptly, with a bitter,
scornful laugh.</p>

<p>He sighed and looked up at the sky with an injured air
of patience and long suffering.</p>

<p>“How little you know me! How cruelly you wrong
me! Alas! it is always thus! One’s best effort on behalf
of others is always met with scorn and incredulity——”</p>

<p>“There is the marquis,” she said, as if she had been
thinking deeply and had not heard his pathetic appeal.
“What do you know about him? How have you got him
in your power?”</p>

<p>“Got the marquis in my power! My dear Lady
Grace——”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” she said. “Do you think I am blind that I
cannot see how different he treats you to others? Is there
any other man who would come to Barton Towers, and be
received as you have been? Is there any other man who
would dare to brave him—yes, and taunt him—as you
have done to-day? You know something about him—you
have some hold upon him. I don’t ask what it is—oh,
no,” she added, quietly, as he smiled, “for I know that
you would not tell me or would palm off some smooth
falsehood——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lady Grace, Lady Grace!” he answered, plaintively;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
but there was a flicker of self-jubilation and satisfaction
on his smiling face.</p>

<p>“It is so, or why should he, who is civil to no one else,
be civil to you? You know why I am here?” she said,
abruptly, as if to throw him off his guard. But the ruse
failed utterly; he turned his smiling face to her, suavely.</p>

<p>“I can guess,” he said, softly.</p>

<p>Her face flushed, then grew hard and defiant.</p>

<p>“Of course you can! Guess? You know! I am here
because I was ‘commanded’ by the marquis; I am here
because his mightiness pleases to wish that I should——”</p>

<p>He glanced over his shoulder warningly.</p>

<p>“Is it wise to speak so loudly, my lady?”</p>

<p>She made a gesture of impatient self-scorn.</p>

<p>“What does it matter? Why should I care who knows
it? I am here that I may learn to regard myself as the
future wife of the future marquis! And you know it.”</p>

<p>He looked at her quietly, with a frank, benevolent regard—-just
the look one bestows on an irritable child.</p>

<p>“And is that so distasteful?” he asked. Her face crimsoned,
and her eyes drooped, and his smile grew broader.
“Not distasteful, I should say,” he murmured; “quite the
reverse. Lady Grace, let me return you a compliment.
You praised me for my power of acting; yours is a great
deal higher! You wanted me to believe that the marquis’
idea was repugnant, whereas——” he chuckled, smoothly.</p>

<p>Her face had grown crimson again, and she turned it
from him for a moment, then faced him again.</p>

<p>“Well!” she said, “and if I do wish it, what then? Is
it so unnatural? Are there many better matches, many
better men than Cecil Neville?”</p>

<p>“Few, if any!” he assented, blandly. “He is young,
handsome, popular, brave, and—a future marquis!” She
picked at the moss in the crevice of the stone coping. “A
very good match, indeed, and Lady Grace is worthy of
such a partner, truly!”</p>

<p>“And you mean to do your best or your worst for the
match?” he said, swiftly.</p>

<p>He took out a cigarette.</p>

<p>“May I?” he asked, then lit it, and leaning on the railing,
surveyed the beautiful scene as if he were quite absorbed
in peaceful contemplation, and had quite forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
his companion and the subject of their conversation.
Then he turned his head, and smiled at her. “No,” he
said, slowly and softly, “I mean to do all I can to further
the idea.”</p>

<p>She started slightly, and her lips parted in a faint sigh.</p>

<p>“You do! You—you mean to help me! and why?”</p>

<p>He was silent again, smoking with placid, serene enjoyment
for a moment or two, then he replied:</p>

<p>“If I were to answer that I am prompted solely by a
desire for your happiness——”</p>

<p>She made a movement of impatience.</p>

<p>“You see!” he said, reproachfully. “You would not
believe me; so, what is the use? Suppose that we do not
go into my motives. Let us, if it please you, decide that
they are utterly selfish and bad, abandoned and wicked
ones—will that do? Very well! After all, what do my
motives matter? If I can help you, and I think I can, do
not seek to go beyond the mere solid fact of my assistance.
Leave the reasons alone. They can’t matter much, can
they?” and he looked into her eyes with the bland and
innocent gaze of a child.</p>

<p>She moved restlessly.</p>

<p>“If I could trust you!” she said, uneasily.</p>

<p>“I thought I had already proved myself worthy of confidence,”
he said, simply; but there must have been some
hidden significance in his words, for they brought the
blood to Lady Grace’s face, and then left it pale and white
to the lips.</p>

<p>“I—I——” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Oh, do not say anything of the past,” he murmured,
soothingly. “Let us think of the present. We will speak
plainly. It is the dear marquis’ wish that you should
marry Lord Cecil Neville; you being gratified by his
choice and willing to fall in with his views, an old and
tried friend offering his services to you do not hesitate to
avail yourself of them: I am the old and tried friend.”</p>

<p>The last words were more softly and cooingly spoken
than any that had preceded them, but Lady Grace started
up and looked at him suspiciously; he, however, met her
scrutiny with his bland and innocent smile.</p>

<p>“If I really thought you would help me,” she said,
doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“You may think so, for I will,” he answered. “As I
said, never mind my motives—they concern only myself.
And how goes the business? Has our dear friend Cecil—eh?”</p>

<p>She frowned slightly as if the question touched her self-love
and vanity.</p>

<p>“Our dear friend does not at present seem much smitten
by your humble servant’s charms,” she said, with a
short laugh, which only barely hid her vexation.</p>

<p>He smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>“Our young friend is rather spoiled, you see. One cannot
be the favored of the gods in the matter of youth, and
strength, and features, without paying the usual penalty.
Cecil is the most popular man in London. Believe me,
there are twenty young ladies—I could give you their
names”—and his lips curled—“who are, if not dying,
living in love of him.”</p>

<p>“I know,” she said, with hardly restrained impatience.
“Of course, there has been a dead-set at him. That is
very natural, is it not? But—but I don’t think——”</p>

<p>“That the sultan has shown any partiality, that he has
not yet thrown the handkerchief,” he finished for her.
“No,” thoughtfully; “I don’t think he has. His lordship
has, indeed, been so very impartial, not to say invulnerable,
that I have sometimes wondered whether there was
not some young lady hidden away, eh?” and he looked at
her questioningly.</p>

<p>She started, and colored.</p>

<p>“Then there is?” he said at once.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” she replied, musingly. “There may
be. Last night I dined away from the Towers, at the
Thurltons, you know?”</p>

<p>“I know,” he murmured, pleasantly. “Thurlton’s
grandfather was transported for forgery; his wife’s sister
ran away with young Lengard, I remember.”</p>

<p>“Of course, you know all about them, every shameful
secret in the family for generations back?” she said, with
a sigh.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“I have such a dreadfully good memory, dear lady.
Well, you dined there——”</p>

<p>“Yes; and coming home I passed down the High street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
and saw Lord Cecil. He was standing at the door of a
fly, opposite the theatre, talking to a lady, a girl.”</p>

<p>He nodded, and puffed at his cigarette placidly, with
half-closed eyes, looking, indeed, almost asleep; but his
next question proved that he was very much awake.</p>

<p>“Was she pretty, Lady Grace?”</p>

<p>“I only saw her for a moment. Yes,” she admitted,
reluctantly.</p>

<p>“You did not know her?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“No. She was not one of the daughters of any of the
county people; besides, it was a fly. It was opposite the
side entrance——”</p>

<p>“She was an actress,” he interrupted, quietly.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“My dear lady! It is so simple! The fly was the only
one there, or you would not have seen her so plainly; it
was at the side entrance; she was unknown to you. Oh,
plainly it was an actress. And it was she who was with
Lord Cecil this morning.”</p>

<p>“Then you have seen her?” she exclaimed, eagerly.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “only heard her. I met our dear Cecil
in the woods. As I approached, I heard two voices,
though he, of course, denied it. One was a woman’s,
and, though I am not in the habit of laying wagers with
ladies—for they never pay when they lose—I would bet
something considerable that the voice belonged to the
young lady whom you saw talking to Lord Cecil outside
the theatre last night!”</p>

<p>She bit her lip, and the look came into her eyes which
indicates the first approach of the green-eyed monster—jealousy.</p>

<p>“Some worthless actress, painted and powdered. Some
woman old enough to be his mother, though made up as a
girl——”</p>

<p>He shook his head and laughed with serene enjoyment.</p>

<p>“No, no; such an experienced bird as Lord Cecil is not
to be caught with such chaff, my dear lady! Depend
upon it, this girl is young and pretty.”</p>

<p>She twisted her handkerchief in her hands, then smiled
contemptuously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“It must be the Juliet of last night!” she said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Well”—she drew a long breath—“I think I am a
match for a common actress, though she be young and
pretty!” and she raised her head and turned to him defiantly.</p>

<p>He looked at her with the calm eyes of a <i>connoisseur</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think so,” he said, blandly. “Certainly,
I should think so. A match for half-a-dozen of them.
Forgive me if I say that I don’t think there is a more
beautiful woman in England than Lady Grace Peyton, or
a more charming one!”</p>

<p>She took no notice of the compliment; to her ears there
rang a tone of mockery behind the smooth phrases.</p>

<p>“What—what is to be done? What do you advise?”
she asked, after a moment’s pause, and with an affected
indifference which made him smile.</p>

<p>He puffed a thin line of smoke from his sleek lips and
watched it with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he said.</p>

<p>“Nothing?” she repeated.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “Nothing, so far as you are concerned.
Just go on being beautiful and charming—as you cannot
help being—and leave it to me to do the rest. If this is
not a serious business, if his lordship is really only
scratched, why——” He laughed lazily. “If, on the
contrary, he is badly hit, and means business, means to
make her the future Marchioness of Stoyle, why we must
deal with the young lady herself.”</p>

<p>“Deal with her?” she asked, with an eager interest she
did not attempt to conceal.</p>

<p>He nodded at the scenery.</p>

<p>“Yes. There are two ways of going to work, each
suited to the subject we are speaking on. Money and
moral suasion. It may be money in this case; if so——”</p>

<p>“I am rich,” she said, in a quiet undertone. “If the
creature requires to be bought; if——”</p>

<p>“You will do it? Exactly. But the moral suasion?”</p>

<p>“I will leave to you, who have so much of it,” she said,
with a half-sneer.</p>

<p>He laughed softly.</p>

<p>“So they all say, dear lady, but, alas! I am so tender-hearted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
that I can never bring myself to use it! I am all
heart, all heart!” and he laid his hand on the spot in which
the organ is situated, and beamed at her. Then, without
moving a muscle, he went on: “And so, dear Lady
Grace, we had the poor children to an evening party, and
gave them tea and buns, and I am sure you would have
been melted to tears at the sight of their overbrimming
happiness.”</p>

<p>Lady Grace looked round in astonishment, and saw that
Lord Cecil had stepped from one of the windows. Spenser
Churchill’s quick ear had heard him, and hence the
swift change in the topic of conversation.</p>

<p>“Mr. Churchill begging again, Lady Grace?” said
Lord Cecil. “Beware of him; he never comes near you
without an attempt on your purse. What’s it for now,
Spenser; the ‘Indigent Washerwomen,’ or the ‘Chimney
Sweeps’ Orphans?’ He’s chairman or secretary of half-a-dozen
charities—aren’t you, Spenser?—and he won’t
let you rest until you’ve put yourself down for lady
patroness for half of ’em!” and he laughed the short,
frank laugh which was so refreshing a contrast to Spenser
Churchill’s oily one, that Lady Grace felt as if it
washed the other away.</p>

<p>“It’s the ‘Indigent Basketmakers’ Children,’ my dear
Cecil,” said Spenser Churchill, smoothly. “Dear Lady
Grace has consented to become one of our lady patronesses,
have you not, Lady Grace?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she said, indifferently; “and now having
hooked me, I’ll leave you to go for Lord Cecil,” and with
a nod and a smile to the latter, she turned and entered
the house.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill looked after her with a rapt gaze
of benevolent admiration.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful young creature!” he murmured
softly; “and as good as she is beautiful!”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Cecil, seating himself on the balcony, lighting
an immense cigar, and offering his case to Spenser
Churchill, who shrank back and put up his hands with
a gesture of alarm.</p>

<p>“I never smoke anything so—er—huge and strong.
But is she not as good as she is beautiful, now?”</p>

<p>“She is beautiful enough, certainly,” said Lord Cecil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
carelessly; “as to her goodness, why, yes, I suppose she
is good enough. All women are good, especially pretty
ones.”</p>

<p>“I—see,” murmured Churchill, with his head on one
side; “you’d say that—er—there was a faint sign of, shall
we say, temper in dear Lady Grace? Well, perhaps—but—oh,
really you must be mistaken, my dear Cecil; so
charming a creature!”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t accuse her of temper!” said Lord Cecil,
with some astonishment and an amused laugh; “it was
you yourself!”</p>

<p>“No, really? Did I? I’m sure I had no such intention.
But I see you think—eh?—perhaps a little inclined
to jealousy? Well, there may be a touch of that in her
composition, now you speak of it.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil stared at him with a half-amused smile.</p>

<p>“Terrible thing, jealousy, Cecil! My poor father—I
don’t think you knew him?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil shook his head, as he thought, “And no
one else that I ever heard of!”</p>

<p>“My poor dear father,” continued Spenser Churchill,
with a plaintive air of reflection, “had warned me against
that peculiar temperament. ‘Never, my dear Spenser,’
he would say, ‘never marry a jealous-natured woman.
You had better throw yourself into the first horsepond!’”</p>

<p>“And you never have done either?” said Lord Cecil,
knocking the ash off his cigar.</p>

<p>“N—o,” said Spenser Churchill; “and do you really
think that dear Lady Grace has a jealous disposition?
Now, really, Cecil, I think you must be mistaken——”</p>

<p>“Confound it!” said Lord Cecil, “I never said anything
of the kind! Don’t put words I never used into
my mouth, please, Churchill!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you? Then how did I get the idea, I wonder?”
responded the other, looking gravely troubled.
“Surely not from Lady Grace herself? Oh! no—no!”
and he looked extremely pained. “I should very much
regret giving you a wrong impression of my opinion of
that charming young creature, my dear Cecil! Most
charming! Ah! what a wife she will make! You don’t
agree with me—no? Well, perhaps—er—yes, I understand
you. Beauty, however charming it may be, is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the best possession a woman can boast. No! after all,
perhaps, as you think, a young, unsophisticated girl, unaccustomed
to the intoxication of constant admiration,
would prove a more valuable companion for one’s life.
These London belles are—er—like the well-known Oriental
fruit, more beautiful to the eye than the touch,
and——”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>“What on earth are you driving at?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I driving at!” exclaimed Spenser Churchill, opening
his eyes with an innocent stare. “What do you mean, my
dear Cecil? What on earth do you mean?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil clasped his hands round his knees, and
looked at the round, smooth face and extended eyes with
faint amusement.</p>

<p>“You’d make an excellent Chinese puzzle, Churchill,”
he said. “If what you mean is to warn me against marrying
Lady Grace——”</p>

<p>“My dear Cecil,” broke in the soft voice, pitched in a
tone of strained horror.</p>

<p>“You can spare yourself the trouble, for I haven’t the
least intention of doing so—at present.”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill’s thick eyelids quivered almost imperceptibly;
but beyond this faint sign, no other trace of
any emotion was visible at this frank announcement.</p>

<p>“Really?” he said; “I thought—— But, my dear Cecil,
don’t you consider her a most beautiful and charming
woman? and—er—come now, after all, you would find
it difficult to discover a more suitable partner, eh?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil frowned.</p>

<p>“Let us change the subject,” he said, curtly.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you’re right, after all,” said the other,
with bland promptitude. “Yes, no doubt, you are right!
That sort of woman is better in a picture, eh? Yes, we’ll
change the subject! What time do you dine here?”</p>

<p>“Eight,” said Lord Cecil. “I don’t dine at home to-night—at
the Towers,” he corrected himself. “I have an
engagement.”</p>

<p>“Really? I am so sorry! Can’t you put it off—for
my sake? Write and tell the people that you are too
good-natured to dine out when an old friend turns up.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to dine out,” said Lord Cecil, absently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“No; really? Now, where can you be going?”</p>

<p>“I think the marquis was inquiring for you,” said Lord
Neville curtly; “I’ll tell him you are here,” and dropping
from his perch, he sauntered into the house.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill leaned over the balcony and smiled.</p>

<p>“Going to the theatre again!” he murmured, “Yes;
I haven’t been to a country theatre for some time; I really
think I should like to go and see what it is like!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">FOR HIM ALONE.</p>


<p>Doris went home, her heart throbbing with an emotion
which was half pain, half joy.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil Neville had asked her to meet him to-morrow.
“I promise nothing!” she had said, and when she
said it she fully meant that she would not come; and yet,
now, as she walked hurriedly to the lodgings, she knew
that when the morrow arrived, she would feel drawn to
the spot as the steel is drawn to the magnet.</p>

<p>But if she had promised nothing, he had promised.
He had said that he would be at the theatre that night,
and she remembered how her heart had leaped at his
words; even now they rang sweetly in her ears.</p>

<p>Heaven only knows with what delight she dwelt upon
the thought that he would be present, listening to her as
she spoke the passion-laden words of Juliet.</p>

<p>All this was joy, but the pain came on. Alas, that all
our joy should be attended so closely by that grim companion.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Love’s feet are softly shod with pain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>says the poet.</p>


<p>For the first time in her young life she had a secret
from Jeffrey. It had been difficult to tell him yesterday
of her acquaintance with Lord Cecil Neville; she felt now
that it would be impossible to tell him, for she knew that
she could not recount the incidents of their meeting without
letting him know how interested she had become in
this young nobleman, whose head had rested on her knee,
and whose face haunted her night and day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>And she knew that once she had told Jeffrey, he would
forbid her even to see or speak to Lord Neville again.
And this seemed too dreadful for her to bear.</p>

<p>Yes, it had come to this: that the great actress, with
the heart and purity of a child, had become so interested,
so fascinated—if that is the right word—with this stranger,
that the thought of not seeing him again, or hearing
his voice, was intolerable.</p>

<p>Her steps grew less hurried as she neared home, and
her thoughts had crystalized into this shape.</p>

<p>“After all, where is the harm? He is good and kind,
and I have so few friends—no one, excepting dear old
Jeffrey!—that I cannot afford to lose him. Besides, I
shall act better if I know that he is in the theatre. I
don’t know why that is, but it is so. And Jeffrey ought
to be glad of that. Oh, if I could only tell him! But I
cannot!”</p>

<p>Once during the day she did make the effort; she began
to talk about the fields and the beautiful on-coming of
spring, but Jeffrey would not listen. He was full of the
business of the theatre, full of expected offers from the
great London managers, and paid no attention to what
she was saying, merely remarking that, after all, the
open air was the place to study in.</p>

<p>To study in! Yes, she knew that! It was in the open
air that she had first seen Lord Neville, and learned the
way to speak Juliet’s “Good-night!”</p>

<p>She did not leave the house again that day, but spent
it studying her part. There were one or two points that
she had missed, so Jeffrey said, and she went over them
again and again.</p>

<p>And how do you think she mastered them? By imagining
that Lord Neville was the Romeo, and it was for
love of him she suffered and died!</p>

<p>“It was wrong?” Yes, but life is full of wrong, and
it is not until youth is passed; and experience is gained,
that we learn to distinguish the wrong from the right.</p>

<p>The night came, and with it the fly to carry them to
the theatre.</p>

<p>There was an immense crowd collected outside the pit
and gallery doors, and the manager met them with the
glad tidings that all the reserved seats were taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“An immense success, my dear Miss Marlowe. You
have hit them hard!” he said, smiling and nodding.</p>

<p>That he had only spoken truly was patent from the
welcome which she received when she made her first appearance.
A roar went up and shook the very chandelier,
as the slim, graceful, girlish figure entered from
the wings.</p>

<p>As is usual, I believe, with actors, for some minutes
she could not see beyond the footlights; but presently she
began to distinguish faces in the hazy glow, and she saw
the handsome, tanned face she had expected—and longed
for!</p>

<p>He had come then, as he had promised!</p>

<p>He was in the box he had occupied on the preceding
night; leaning forward, his hands clasped on the velvet
edge, his eyes following her every movement.</p>

<p>She lost all consciousness of the rest of the audience,
and played only to those rapt, attentive eyes.</p>

<p>Every word she uttered she spoke to him, every glance
of the blue eyes—which grew violet when she was agitated—though
bent upon the Romeo on the stage, was
meant for the one face in the vast audience.</p>

<p>She played, if anything, better than she had played
last night, and the manager came to her to tell her so.</p>

<p>“Better and better, Miss Marlowe!” he said, bowing
and smiling. “If you go on like this——”</p>

<p>“The house is crammed,” said Jeffrey, who was standing
near the wings with a shawl to throw over Doris’s
shoulders, for like that of most country theatres, the
Barton one was rich in draughts.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the manager, “and a first-class audience.
Did you notice those two side boxes?”</p>

<p>Jeffrey looked.</p>

<p>“They have both got the curtains drawn,” he said.</p>

<p>The manager laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes. They have been drawn like that since the first
scene. I expect that a London manager is behind each,
eh, Miss Marlowe? Ah, I shan’t be able to keep you
long!”</p>

<p>Doris smiled absently and passed on to her dressing-room.</p>

<p>But in the next act she happened to look up at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
right-hand box, and she saw that the curtains had been
drawn aside.</p>

<p>She glanced at it with the pre-occupied look of an actor,
and saw that the only occupant of the box was a young
and very beautiful girl, with dark, flashing eyes, and
bright, golden hair.</p>

<p>The other box remained screened, and the occupant
invisible.</p>

<p>The play proceeded, and then came the shower of bouquets.</p>

<p>Now, Barton is not a floral town by any means, so
that the bouquets which fell at the feet of the girlish
Juliet must have been procured at some pains and trouble.
The Romeo filled his arms with them, and one only
remained lying on the stage.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent bouquet of white and purple violets,
and as it fell, Doris, looking up, saw the handsome
face of Lord Neville close to the stage in the orchestra
stalls.</p>

<p>She stooped and raised the bouquet and glanced at
him, but this time she did not lift the flowers to her lips.</p>

<p>As she passed off, the manager touched her arm.</p>

<p>“I’ve found out who it is that’s got the box on the
prompt side,” he said; “it’s Lady Grace Peyton, the great
London beauty. She’s staying at Barton Towers, the
Marquis of Stoyle’s place, you know.”</p>

<p>“At Barton Towers!” said Doris. Then she went to
the side of the proscenium and looked at the box in which
Lady Grace’s face was just visible. “How beautiful she
is!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think so!” said the manager. “Why,
she’s the professional beauty of the season; it’s an honor
to have her in the theatre! And who else do you think
is here?” he added, exultingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Doris, moving away.</p>

<p>“Why, Lord Cecil Neville, the marquis’ nephew, and
he was here last night! What do you think of that? It
isn’t only the pit and gallery that have gone mad over
you, Miss Marlowe, but the gentry, too! Just as I said
last night! Lord Cecil Neville; I daresay you haven’t
heard of him, but he’s the best-known man in London.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
I wish I knew who was in the other box, but I can’t find
out.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s the marquis himself,” said Doris, with
an absent smile.</p>

<p>“Oh! no!” said the manager; “he’d be with Lord Neville
or Lady Grace! No, it’s not the marquis!”</p>

<p>She went and dressed for the last and great scene, and
when she came out found Jeffrey pacing up and down.</p>

<p>“Better than last night, Doris,” he said nodding, and
glancing at her under his thick frowning brows. “You
have made all the points to-night; that’s right! Keep
cool! Don’t let your head be turned by the applause,
and the bouquets. What! Violets again to-night?
Very kind, very characteristic! Let me hold them for
you,” and he held out his hand for the bouquet, which,
unthinkingly, she had brought out with her.</p>

<p>She extended them to him, when, her eyes dwelling on
them, she saw a mark of white among the purple blossoms.</p>

<p>Then she gave them to him, saying hurriedly, “Take
care of them: they smell so sweet,” and went and took
her place at the wing, crushing the piece of paper into
the bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>She had to wait some few minutes, and with a quickly
throbbing heart she took out the paper and glanced at it.</p>

<p>A scribble in pencil ran across it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Will you meet me in the fields to-morrow? I must speak
to you.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Cecil Neville.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>That was all. She replaced the paper in her bosom,
where it seemed to burn like a living thing and went on
the stage.</p>

<p>If her performance in this scene on the preceding night
was good, this, to-night, was much in advance of it. Her
voice seemed to thrill the vast audience, and, with her
face, moved them to tears.</p>

<p>But Doris was conscious of only one spectator and
auditor, the one who leaned forward in the centre box,
with the rapt attention of a devotee at a shrine.</p>

<p>The curtain fell amidst a thunder of applause, and, pale
and quivering, she was led on by the Romeo to receive
the enthusiastic expression of approbation and delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“Wonderful, Miss Marlowe!” said the Romeo.
“Miles ahead of last night, and that was good enough.”</p>

<p>She was about to acknowledge the frank and generous
compliment, when she felt her arm seized, and saw Jeffrey
standing beside her.</p>

<p>His face was white and drawn, the sunken eyes blazing
with passion.</p>

<p>“Doris! Doris!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Jeffrey!” she said, half frightened. “What is the
matter?”</p>

<p>“Look, look!” he panted hoarsely, and he drew the edge
of the curtain back and pointed to a box on the right-hand
side.</p>

<p>Doris looked and saw a fair, pleasant-looking man
standing in the front of the box. He was watching the
dispersing audience with a gentle smile, and his fat white
hand was softly smoothing his long, fair hair from his
forehead. He looked benevolent enough to be a bishop,
and Doris stared from him to the white ashen face of
Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“What is it, dear Jeffrey?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Look! look!” he repeated hoarsely. “There stands
your greatest enemy, save one! Your greatest enemy in
the world! Look at him, Doris! Look at him and remember
him!”</p>

<p>She turned her eyes to the box.</p>

<p>“That fair gentleman with the long hair, do you mean,
Jeffrey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is him! Curse him! Curse him!” he muttered.
Then suddenly he seemed to recover himself.</p>

<p>“Come away!” he said brokenly. “Don’t pay any
attention to what I have said. It—it is nothing!” and he
let the edge of the curtain fall.</p>

<p class="center">LOVE’S SUBTLE SPELL.</p>


<p>At any other time Doris would have been alarmed at
Jeffrey’s sudden outburst of rage, occasioned by the
sight of the amiable-looking stranger in the box, but she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
could think of nothing but the little white note lying
hidden in the bunch of violets which Lord Cecil Neville
had thrown to her.</p>

<p>It was the first note she had received in that way, and
she felt guilty and unhappy.</p>

<p>If she had only told Jeffrey on the first of her acquaintance
with Lord Neville! She would have taken the
note to him, if she had done so; but she felt that to place
it in his hands now would be to call forth one of his fierce
outbursts of rage, in which it was quite possible he
might seek Lord Neville and force a quarrel on him.</p>

<p>What should she do? The question haunted her all
the way home. Should she write and tell Lord Neville
that she could not meet him, and request him not to
write to her again? This seemed the easiest thing to do,
but she shrank from it for two reasons: One, because
Jeffrey had often warned her against writing to strangers,
and the other, because it seemed so stern a rebuke for
so slight an offense.</p>

<p>For, after all, his sin was not so great. He had asked
permission to call upon her, asked it respectfully and with
all the deference of a gentleman addressing a lady his
equal in position, and she had refused to grant him the
permission. If he wanted to see her, what else could he
do than write and ask her to meet him?</p>

<p>Once she nearly summoned up courage to tell Jeffrey
everything, but, as she looked up at him as he leaned
back in the corner of the fly, with bent head and folded
arms, she saw so stern and moody an expression on his
face that her courage failed her; he was just in the
humor to consider the note an insult, and seek to
avenge it.</p>

<p>And somehow Doris could not regard it in this way.
As she read the words, she seemed to hear Lord Neville’s
deep, musical voice pronouncing them, pleadingly,
respectfully, with reverence rather than insult.</p>

<p>Doris was a great actress, but she was as ignorant of the
world outside the theatre as a child; she had only her instinct
to guide her, and that seemed to say that it was
impossible Lord Neville could have meant to insult her!</p>

<p>But the result of all her thinking was this: That her
acquaintance with him must cease. She must have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
friends save those of the theatre; least of all, a young nobleman
who tossed her bouquets of violets, and begged
her to meet him in the meadows!</p>

<p>Jeffrey’s mood clung to him during the remainder of
the night. As a rule, after their supper, which was an
exceedingly simple one, he grew cheerful and talkative;
but to-night he sat with bent head and frowning brows,
apparently brooding over the past.</p>

<p>Once or twice she saw him look up at her with a half-troubled
glance; then, as his eyes met hers, he compressed
his lips and sighed; and after a while he said suddenly:</p>

<p>“You are happy, Doris?”</p>

<p>She started slightly and the color rushed to her face.
It almost seemed as if he knew something was troubling
her.</p>

<p>“Happy, Jeffrey? Yes,” she said, and she went and
sat at his feet and folded her hands on his knee.</p>

<p>He looked down into her beautiful face—not into her
eyes, for they were downcast.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, moodily and absently, as if he were
communing with his own thoughts rather than addressing
her, “yes, you are happy; how could it be otherwise?
All that I have wished for has come to pass. You are a
great actress, you will be famous. The world will be at
your feet—even as you are now at mine! It will hang
upon your voice, watch with breathless interest your
face, pour its gold into your lap. Great, famous; you are—you
must be—happy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jeffrey,” she said, “and I owe it all to you.”</p>

<p>“To me?” he said. “Yes. But if you do, it is a debt
that I myself owed. To you, to her——”</p>

<p>“To her?” she murmured, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“To Lucy, to your mother,” he said, still absently.</p>

<p>“To my mother?” said Doris, with bated breath.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, then he seemed as if
awakening from a dream.</p>

<p>“Doris,” he said, gravely, and with visible emotion,
“there is something I must tell you. I ought to have
told you before this; but I put it off. I would put it off
now—” his lips quivered—“for I hate the thought of it.
But to-night my conscience has been roused. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
man—” he stopped, and his teeth clicked. “Doris!” he
exclaimed, with a catch in his breath. “Tell me, have I
not been as a father to you? Could any father have
striven more hardly for his daughter’s good? Could any
father have loved you better, and lived for you more
solely and entirely than I have done?”</p>

<p>“No, Jeffrey, none!” she said, in a low voice, and laying
her soft, white hand upon his rugged and gnarled
one soothingly.</p>

<p>“I call Heaven to witness that I have only had one
thought, your welfare. When you lay, a little child, in
my arms, I devoted my life to you. Every hour of
the day I have thought of you, and planned out your
future. It was not my own happiness I sought, not my
own ambition, but yours—yours! I have lived and
striven for one end—your success, and your happiness!
And I have won! You are a great actress, Doris, and
it is I—I!—who have taught and trained and made you
what you are!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jeffrey,” she murmured, “I know it! and I am
grateful—grateful!”</p>

<p>“But are you happy? Are you happy, child?” he demanded,
and his voice sounded almost stern in its intensity.</p>

<p>The color came and went in her face.</p>

<p>“How could I be otherwise, Jeffrey?” she said. “Yes,
I am happy!”</p>

<p>He drew a long breath, as of relief, but went on—</p>

<p>“Compare your lot with others. I don’t mean the poor
and commonplace; but those others, the rich, the well-born,
the titled. Would you have been happier, for instance,
if you had been—let me say—the daughter of a
nobleman——”</p>

<p>She smiled at the question, earnestly as it was put.</p>

<p>“I don’t know any daughters of noblemen, Jeffrey,”
she said; “but I don’t think I would exchange places
with any of them.”</p>

<p>He nodded, and laid his hand upon her head.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said, moodily.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, with a faint laugh. “I would not exchange
places with the highest lady in the land! To be
able to move a theatre full of people to tears or laughter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
that is better than being an earl’s daughter, is it not,
Jeffrey?”</p>

<p>He started.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he said, eagerly; “that is what I wanted you
to feel! Any one can be an earl’s daughter, but few!—how
few!—the Doris Marlowe who wrought an audience
to enthusiasm to-night?”</p>

<p>She smiled up at him.</p>

<p>“And what is this that you are going to tell me, Jeffrey?”</p>

<p>He started, and his hand fell from her head.</p>

<p>“I—I—” he said, uncertainly, “I don’t think I’ll tell
you to-night, Doris; it will keep. I’m not certain that
it would make you happier; I’m half inclined to think that
it would only make you miserable. No!—I won’t tell
you. Go to bed, and forget——” He stopped.</p>

<p>“Forget that pleasant-looking gentleman in the box,
Jeffrey?” she said, with a smile.</p>

<p>His face darkened, and the hand that rested on the
table clenched tightly.</p>

<p>“You saw him!—you saw him!” he said, with suppressed
fury. “Remember him, Doris! He is a villain!—a
scoundrel! He is your, and my, greatest enemy——”</p>

<p>“That smiling, fair-haired gentleman?” she said.</p>

<p>“One may smile, and smile, and then be a villain,
Doris,” he said, quoting “Hamlet.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t tell me who he is and all about him,
Jeffrey?”</p>

<p>“Not to-night,” he said, knitting his brows. “Go now,
Doris. Some other time——”</p>

<p>She touched his forehead with her lips, and stole away
from him quietly, and went upstairs.</p>

<p>She slept little that night. The roar of the crowded
theatre seemed to force its way into the white little room,
and with it mingled Jeffrey’s strange words hinting at
some fraud, and the words of Lord Cecil Neville’s note.</p>

<p>The morning broke clear and bright, and she came
down, looking rather pale and grave.</p>

<p>Jeffrey ate his breakfast almost in silence, and there
was no trace of last night’s emotions on his broad brow.
As was usual with him, he went down to the theatre directly
after breakfast, and Doris was left alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>The time had now arrived in which she must decide
what she must do respecting Lord Neville’s note.</p>

<p>She opened her writing-case, and, after sitting before
it for half-an-hour, wrote an answer in which she declined
a meeting with him; and it gave her satisfaction for a few
minutes, at the end of which she—tore it up!</p>

<p>No answer she could pen—and she tried hard—seemed
satisfactory. Some were too familiar, others too
stiff and haughty.</p>

<p>“I shall have to see him!” she murmured, at last, as
if in despair—“for the last time!” A thrill of regret ran
through her at the words; they sounded so sad and significant.</p>

<p>Trying to frame some form of words in which she
could speak to him, she made her way to the meadows,
and as she went the beauty of the spring morning
seemed to take to itself a new and strange loveliness,
and, notwithstanding her difficult task, the thought that
she was going to meet him again filled her with a vague,
indescribable sensation that half-pleased, half-troubled
her.</p>

<p>All the place was silent save for the singing of the
birds and the babbling of the brook, and as she seated
herself on the mossy bank she looked round, as one
views a place rendered familiar and pleasant by associations.</p>

<p>Wherever she went, whatever happened to her in the
future, she thought, she should always remember Barton
meadows, the clump of elms, the silver brook, and—ah,
yes!—the handsome face lying so still and white in her
lap.</p>

<p>As she was recalling the scene, dwelling on it with a
singular commingling of pleasure and pain, she heard the
beat of a horse’s hoofs, just as she had heard it the first
morning; and Lord Neville came flying over the hedge,
a little further from her this time, and still upon his
horse, and not upon his head.</p>

<p>He pulled the animal up almost on its haunches, and,
slipping from the saddle, hurried toward her.</p>

<p>In the second that she raised her eyes, she took in, as
if by a species of mental photography, the handsome
face with its clear and now eager eyes, the graceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
figure, in its suit of gray cords that seemed to be part
and parcel of the wearer, and the air—distinguished, patrician,
it is so difficult to describe it, which is the birthright
of the gentleman—the air which the parvenu,
though he count his gold by the million, cannot purchase.</p>

<p>“You have come!” he said, raising his hat. “I am so
glad, so grateful, Miss Marlowe.”</p>

<p>“You would not be, Lord Neville, if you knew how
sorry I am to be here,” she said, and her wonderful eyes
met his ardent gaze steadily and with a gravity that lent
a subtle and altogether new charm to her face.</p>

<p>His face fell.</p>

<p>“Sorry?” he said, regretfully.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said; “very, very sorry. Lord Neville, you
should not have written me that note; it was wrong.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you,” he said, eagerly, pleadingly; “I
feared you would say this——”</p>

<p>“I did not intend to come,” she said, as if he had not
spoken. “I meant to pass the note by unanswered. But
it seemed—well, yes, unkind. And I tried to write,
but——” her brows came together, “I could not please
myself. It is so hard to write such a letter for the first
time in one’s life, and at last I decided to meet you, that I
might tell you how wrong you were, and that your note
showed me—ah! so plainly—that we must not meet
again—that, in short, Lord Neville, our acquaintance
must cease!”</p>

<p>She actually half rose, as if she were about to leave
him then and there; but he put out his hand pleadingly,
without daring to touch her, and implored her to wait.</p>

<p>“Don’t go—for a moment, only a moment!” he
pleaded. “Let me speak in my defense. Do listen to me!
I only ask you to listen to me!”</p>

<p>She sank down again slowly, reluctantly, as it seemed,
and he threw himself beside her, bending forward, his
eyes fixed upon her face, all alight with the ardent desire
to turn aside her anger, to melt her coldness.</p>

<p>“Why did you write that note?” she said.</p>

<p>“Why—I was mad!” he said. “Stop—I was mad; I
wrote it while I was in the theatre. It was wrong, I
know, of course; but I’m not sorry that I wrote it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>She turned her eyes with surprise and reproach upon
him.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not sorry!” he said, almost defiantly. “I
wrote it during the <i>entr’acte</i>; I’d been watching you and
listening to you until—well, until I had lost myself, I
suppose. Anyhow, I got the piece of paper and wrote on
it, and put it among the violets, all in a moment, as it
were. I felt that I must see you again—wait, ah, wait
and hear me out!” for she had made a movement that
seemed to threaten her departure. “I don’t know how
long I may be here; I may go at any moment—from Barton,
I mean; and then, as I thought that I might not see
you again for weeks, for months, perhaps——” he
stopped, not because he had no words, but for breath,
and to regain his composure. “I knew you would be
angry, but—what was I to do? You had forbidden me—well,
you hadn’t given me permission to call on you——”</p>

<p>She caught her under-lip in her teeth; he was using
the argument in his defense which she had used for him
in the morning.</p>

<p>—“And I thought I would write it. Miss Marlowe,
you shall blame me for sending that note to you, for asking
you to meet me here. It was wrong, impertinent,
whatever you like to call it, but I had a distinct object——”</p>

<p>She did not start, but looked at him for a moment with
faint surprise, then looked at the brook.</p>

<p>“I wanted to tell you something,” he said, not so
smoothly or glowing now, but with a sudden gravity in
his voice, an intensity in the expression of his eyes that
ought to have warned her; but it did not, for she looked
at him with calm surprise.</p>

<p>“It will sound sudden to you, sudden and abrupt, I
daresay,” he said. “I—I can’t help it! It seems sudden
to me, and yet sometimes I feel as if I had known you for
years—all my life. Miss Marlowe, when a man finds that
the face and the voice of a girl are haunting him day and
night, that he cannot drive them out of his head for half
a minute, when he is only happy when he is near her and
altogether wretched when he is away from her, there is
only one explanation: He is in love with that girl. I
am in love with you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>The blood rushed to Doris’s face, then left it white to
the lips.</p>

<p>She drew her eyes away from his slowly and sat mute
and motionless.</p>

<p>“I love you!” he said, bending a little nearer to her,
the words fraught with the intensity—and the truth—of a
man’s passion. “I love you with all my heart and soul!”
He drew a long breath. “That is why I wrote to you,
that is what I had to say to you—wait a moment, I know
what you are going to say—perhaps you are going to
laugh. For Heaven’s sake, don’t, for this is a serious
business for me!”</p>

<p>She made a slight gesture of negation.</p>

<p>“No, forgive me; I was wrong! You would not laugh!
But I know what you will say—that I have only seen
you a few times, that I have only spoken to you on two
occasions. Well, I know. Do you think I haven’t told
myself all that? I have, a hundred times; but it doesn’t
alter the fact. I do love you. I know that, and that’s
about all I know of it.” His deep, musical voice was
tremulous for a moment, but he mastered it. “And I
don’t wonder at it! Where is the man with half-a-heart
in his bosom who wouldn’t love you! I have never seen
any one so beautiful—half so beautiful!”</p>

<p>She moved her hand as if to silence him, but he went
on.</p>

<p>“And I’ve sat for hours, fascinated—feeling my heart
drawn out of me by your face, your voice! Why, look
how you move the rest of the people at the theatre, and
think what it must mean to me, who loved you the very
first time I saw you! Ah, Miss Marlowe—Doris—let me
call you Doris for once!—if I could only tell you how
dearly and truly and passionately I love you! But I
can’t. I know it’s no use. Who am I that you should
feel anything but amusement——”</p>

<p>“Do not say that,” she said, in a low voice, almost inaudible,
indeed.</p>

<p>“You are as beautiful as an angel, and as clever—why,
you are famous already, and I”—he laughed with self-scorn—“I’m
just an ordinary fool of a fellow. Of course,
there is no hope for me, and yet somehow I felt that I
must tell you. You won’t laugh, I know. You’ll tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
that I’m very foolish, and that we mustn’t meet again—and—and
all that”—he rose, but sank down again, and
touched her arm reverently—“and you’ll send me away
and—and—perhaps forget all about me in a week or two.
While I—well—” he pushed the short, crisp hair from his
brow with an impatient gesture—“well, I shall get over it
in time. No!” he said, simply, passionately, “I shall
never forget you. If I live to be a hundred I shall never
forget the other day when I opened my eyes and saw you
bending over me, or those next two nights when I looked
at you in the theatre! I shall never forget, nor cease to
love you! I know it as surely as I stand here!”</p>

<p>He rose and thrust his hands in his pockets, and looked
down at her, his handsome face set hard, his eyes dwelling
upon her with the hungry look of the man who loves
and yet does not hope.</p>

<p>“And now, I’ve told you,” he said, with a short breath,
“and now I suppose it’s ‘good-by, Lord Neville, I hope
you will be happy and——’” His voice broke, and he
knelt beside her and caught her hand. “Miss Marlowe!
Doris! If—if there is the slightest chance for me! If
there is the least bit of hope in the world, give it to me!
I’m—I’m like a man pleading for his life! For his life?
For more than that—his happiness——” He stopped
sudden, smitten silent, for the hand that was free had
gone up to her face and covered her eyes, and she was
trembling.</p>

<p>She had heard love made to her on the stage, and it
had meant—just her “cue,” no more; this was the first
time the accents of a real, genuine passion had ever smote
upon her ear, and its tones thrilled to her heart.</p>

<p>She trembled with joy, with fear, with doubt, with the
almost irrepressible longing to hide her burning face upon
his breast, and give words to the cry that rang in her
heart, “I love you! I love you!”</p>

<p>“Doris!” he said; “Doris!” and there was truth in his
voice. “For Heaven’s sake, don’t cry! I’m not worth
it; I am not, indeed! Are you crying? Don’t! I’ll—I’ll
go——”</p>

<p>She put out her hand and laid it gently on his arm as
gently as a butterfly alights upon a flower.</p>

<p>He caught it and drew nearer to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Doris! Is it possible? Do you—may I hope?
Doris! Oh, my darling, my darling!” and his strong
arms wound round her, and his kisses fell like hot rain
upon her hair and eyelids.</p>

<p>For a moment she surrendered herself to the storm of
passion, as a tree bends before the whirlwind; then she
put her hands palm-wise upon his breast, and gently kept
him from her.</p>

<p>“Oh, wait, wait!” she murmured. “I don’t know——”</p>

<p>“Don’t know! Don’t know whether you love me, you
mean?” he said, kneeling beside her, and gazing hungrily
in her face, ready to swoop down upon her with renewed
caresses.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, and her voice came in a whisper. “It
is all so—so sudden! I don’t know——”</p>

<p>“My darling!” he whispered. “Let me ask you! I
know what love means, for I learned it from my love for
you. Look at me, Doris!”</p>

<p>She raised her eyes—they seemed weighted with lead—and
let them rest upon his ardent, glowing face.</p>

<p>“Let me ask you,” he said, “would you like me to be
unhappy? Would you like me to leave you, to go away
from you, not for an hour, or a day, but forever?”</p>

<p>A faint shudder shook her, and the hands touching his
breast half-closed on him.</p>

<p>“Would you be happy if I were miles away, and there
were no chance of ever seeing me again? Doris, answer
me; shall I go? Will you say ‘good-by?’”</p>

<p>He drew back from her in a feint of leaving her, and
her small, soft hands closed upon him.</p>

<p>“No, no!”</p>

<p>He asked for no more. With a cry of joy he drew her
to him and kissed her, all unrebuked this time.</p>

<p>“My darling!—my beautiful!” he murmured. “Oh,
Doris, is it true—can it be true? Tell me, dearest; I can’t
believe it otherwise. Tell me, do you love me just a
little?” and he looked into her downcast eyes as if he
would read her soul.</p>

<p>She put her hand upon his arm and raised her eyes to
his slowly, and let them rest there.</p>

<p>“Yes!” she said, as if the effort cost her much; “I do
love you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>A linnet, perched upon a branch of the tree above them,
burst into song; a lamb, that had been regarding them
curiously, drew near and bleated; the brook babbled over
the stones; all nature in its happy springtide seemed to
take up the harmony of these two souls bound in Love’s
subtle spell, and to find voice; but they were silent.</p>

<p>At last he spoke.</p>

<p>“It is like a dream!” he said, removing his eyes from
her face for a moment and looking round like a man
awaking from sleep. “Like a dream! Tell me once
more, Doris; just once more!”</p>

<p>“Is it so difficult to believe? Well, then—I love you!”
she murmured, and a smile—the first fruit of love—beamed
from her eyes.</p>

<p>“Difficult to believe!” he said; “well, I should think so!
Great Heaven! what on earth do you see in me to love?”</p>

<p>“Quite enough,” she said, the smile growing sunnier,
as she looked at his handsome face and ardent eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful!” he said. “Just look at the difference
between us: you, so beautiful, so clever, such a genius;
oh, I know! Why, you will be famous—are famous
already, I daresay—and I!” he laughed with self-scorn.
“It is wonderful!” and he drew her hand to his lips and
kissed it.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” she said, slowly, with loving mockery.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” he asseverated. “Simply wonderful!
And to think that you belong to me! You, you, you!”
and his eyes flashed upon her lovely, bewitching face.
“By Jove, I shall wake up presently, and find that it really
is only a dream.”</p>

<p>She started, and would have withdrawn her hand if it
had not been so tightly clasped in his.</p>

<p>“It is only a dream,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Only a dream?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “A—a—very pleasant dream——”</p>

<p>“Thank you!”</p>

<p>“But a dream still, Lord Neville——”</p>

<p>“My name is Cecil, I’d have you to know!”</p>

<p>“Lord Cecil——”</p>

<p>“Cecil, without the ‘lord,’ if you please.”</p>

<p>“It is only a dream! We must wake now! I—and
you—have forgotten!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Forgotten what, dearest?” he said.</p>

<p>“Forgotten who you are, and what I am.”</p>

<p>“You are an angel!” he remarked, seating himself beside
her, and stealing his arm round her waist.</p>

<p>“I am an actress, and you are a viscount,” she said.</p>

<p>“I believe I am,” he said, smilingly. “But, all the same,
you are an angel! Every moment I expect to see you
spread your wings, and fly from me.”</p>

<p>“So I shall directly,” she said, with a smile that was
half-sorrowful. “I am an actress—one of the people!
One who has no status, no standing in the world; and you
are a nobleman! You will be a marquis some day, will
you not?”</p>

<p>“I daresay,” he assented, carelessly, trying to decide
whether she was more beautiful, grave or smiling.</p>

<p>“There is a gulf between you and me, Lord Neville!”</p>

<p>“Cecil, if you please!”</p>

<p>“A gulf——”</p>

<p>“Which love can stride across,” he said. “That is, if
you are going to draw up a list of comparisons! As if
there could be any comparison between Doris Marlowe,
the great actress, and Cecil Neville, the stupid dragoon!”</p>

<p>“And future marquis!” she said. “Ah, I know! Yes,
there’s a gulf!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Doris,” he said, taking her hand, which she
had withdrawn, and kissing each finger separately; “don’t
talk nonsense. I’m a future marquis. All right. I don’t
deny it.”</p>

<p>“You cannot.”</p>

<p>“Just so—I cannot. But I’m not a marquis at present.
I’m simply Cecil Neville! I’m not even a dragoon, for—confound
him!—the marquis made me retire! I’m simply
nothing, while you—you!” he emphasized the pronoun
by raising the edge of her dress and kissing it, “you are a
great and famous actress——”</p>

<p>“And outside the pale of society,” she said, with sudden
wisdom.</p>

<p>“Society!” he exclaimed, “what do I care for that? I
never cared very much for it; at this moment I care less.
You are society enough for me!”</p>

<p>No woman could have been otherwise than touched by
his devotion; she allowed him to retain her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“If you only knew what a sacrifice you are making, my
darling!” he said, smilingly. “Why, presently you will
appear in London, and will find the world at your feet;
and they will all be in love with you, peasants—only there
are no peasants in London—and peers! I daresay you
would have an offer from a duke! Think of that! And
you have pledged your troth to a simple viscount!”</p>

<p>“I am satisfied,” she said, with a smile.</p>

<p>“And precious little you have to be satisfied with!” he
said, “for I am a poor kind of viscount. I am entirely at
the mercy of the great marquis—the Marquis of Stoyle!
He forced me to leave the army, where I had a chance,
and he keeps me on starvation allowance. Oh! you had
better have waited and hooked your duke, Doris!”</p>

<p>She laughed softly, but the laugh was rather a grave
one.</p>

<p>“What will the marquis say?” she asked, looking at
him, with her brows drawn, her lovely eyes half-curious.</p>

<p>Lord Neville smiled.</p>

<p>“He will be sure to say something disagreeable; he
always does.”</p>

<p>“But tell me,” she insisted, gently. “Or shall I tell
you?”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t,” he said. “That beautiful face of yours
couldn’t manage to look like the marquis’ hard, stony one,
and certainly your voice that is just like music——”</p>

<p>“Shall I get up and curtsey?” she put in, with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>“You needn’t; it’s no compliment. No, you couldn’t
harden your voice to anything approaching the marquis’
steely, icy tones.”</p>

<p>“No?” she said, absently; then suddenly she sat upright,
and her face grew set and cold, and her eyes hardened
with a disdainful hauteur. “So, Cecil!” she said, and her
voice was stern and cuttingly scornful, “so you have made
up your mind to marry—what is it?—a dairymaid—no,
pardon me!—an actress! An actress, a social pariah, a
person one pays one’s money to see upon the stage, to
make us laugh for an hour or two, but with whom one
would rather not be seen walking in the public streets;
and you propose to marry this—this girl? Well, do so,
but remember that in marrying her you cut yourself off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
from me and the world to which you belong, and that
you sink into the mud from which she sprang, and are
utterly ruined, a social suicide!”</p>

<p>Lord Neville sat and stared at her.</p>

<p>It was not the words, dramatic though they were, which
amazed him, but the face, the voice.</p>

<p>“Why, Doris,” he said, at last, “you have seen, you
know the marquis?”</p>

<p>She shook her head as her countenance resumed its
own girlish freshness and beauty.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, gently. “I have never seen him.”</p>

<p>“No? Well, of all the extraordinary likenesses! It
was my esteemed uncle the marquis—making an allowance
for the difference in age and the rest—to a point!”</p>

<p>“You forget that I am an actress,” she said, with a
little sigh. “It was easy enough, as easy to guess what
he—what any one in his position would say to his nephew
and heir when he told him what he proposed doing! It is
something like what he would say, is it not?”</p>

<p>“It was a wonderful imitation of the marquis’ expression
and way of talking—wonderful, darling!—but I
don’t think he would have said so much. But there, what
difference can it make what he says or thinks, eh, Doris?”
he broke off.</p>

<p>“But will it make no difference?” she asked, leaning
forward, her hands clasped on her knees, her eyes fixed
dreamily on the ground. “I know there must be a sacrifice—let
me know how great a one. What difference will
it make?” and she looked at him.</p>

<p>Lord Neville frowned slightly as he thought of the
speech his uncle had addressed to him after dinner on his
first night at the Towers, and she saw the frown and
sighed.</p>

<p>“The sacrifice would be greater even than I thought,”
she said. “Is it not so? I—yes, I am so ignorant of the
world. I know nothing about it, excepting what I have
learned from books and plays——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say another word!” he broke in, almost grimly
in his earnestness. “Every word you say makes me
ashamed! Do you think I set anything in the scales
against your love? The marquis may say and do what
he pleases; he may curse or bless me, and it won’t make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
any difference! All the same—I mention it for your sake,
and not my own, you seem so afraid, my darling; he can’t
rob me of the title, and if he could I would surrender it
rather than lose you. Lose you!” he exclaimed, with his
short laugh. “Look here, Doris, I’d rather be your husband,
and—and sweep a crossing, than marry another
woman and be the future King of England! That
sounds rather high and lofty, doesn’t it? But I’m rather
bad at expressing myself, and it’s as near as I can get to
my meaning!”</p>

<p>“It is near enough,” she said, with a smile, her heart
giving a little leap at his ardent, manly avowal.</p>

<p>“And that’s enough of the marquis,” he said. “We’ve
forgotten quite as important a person, it seems to me.
Your guardian, Doris!”</p>

<p>She started slightly.</p>

<p>“Jeffrey!” she murmured. “Ah, yes!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lord Neville. “Now, I value his goodwill
quite as much as I do my uncle’s, and I don’t feel at all
sure that I shall get it. You see, with all deference to
you, sweetheart——”</p>

<p>Sweetheart! She whispered the word to herself and
glowed over it.</p>

<p>“I’m not, in all points, the very best kind of young man
for a husband, and your guardian is very likely to remark
it. What if he should refuse his consent?”</p>

<p>Her face grew faintly troubled.</p>

<p>“Jeffrey refuse!” she said, almost to herself. “N—o.
Not if——”</p>

<p>“Not if you wished for it very much?” he said, divining
her meaning. “I see! And I’m not surprised. I
can’t imagine any man stony-hearted enough to refuse you
anything, even such an unwise thing as this! Look here,
Doris, I’ll go back home with you and see him.”</p>

<p>The trouble on her face grew more marked.</p>

<p>“I hate suspense and delay, and, well, I want to feel
sure, quite sure, that you are my very own! You don’t
mind my going home with you and telling him straight
out, do you?”</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, then she looked at him, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“No, do not. I——” She stopped. “I think I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
rather see him first. I—I could tell him. Ah, do you
not see how suddenly it would come upon him? How
unprepared——”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told him anything about me?”</p>

<p>The color rose to her face.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, and her eyes were downcast. “No, I
have not told him; he would be so surprised and——I
will see him first and tell him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “Then, to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow,” she said, with a little sigh of relief.
“I wish I could tell you all he has been to me, how tender
and loving—father, mother, brother! Ah, I have had no
one else but him in the world, and he has devoted all his
life to me!”</p>

<p>“I will never forget that,” said Lord Neville, gravely,
“and I will try and thank him to-morrow! Yes, I can
understand how hard it will seem to him to have to lose
you. But, Doris, he need not do that. He has stood in
a father’s place to you; I shall not oust him from it, or
separate you from him. There is room in that big heart
of yours for both of us, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>She turned to him as if moved by an irresistible impulse,
and held out her hands, and her eyes were full of
tears.</p>

<p>“If I had not loved you until this moment, I should
now,” she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Of course, he captured the little quivering hands, and
they sat in silence for a minute or two. Then suddenly
she started.</p>

<p>“The time!” she exclaimed. “I had forgotten! There
is a rehearsal,” and she sprang to her feet. “No, no!”
pressing her fingers on his shoulder. “You must not
come—not an inch of the way. I—I want to be alone to
think—to think!” She stopped, with a little, dazed air,
and smiled down at him.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you are tired of me——” he said, with a loving
mockery. “To-morrow, Doris, in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow—ah, what a long time!” she whispered,
almost inaudibly. “Let me think. If I cannot
come—there may be a rehearsal——”</p>

<p>He looked disappointed—man like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“I shall be here,” he said, “and I’ll wait all day if you
like.”</p>

<p>She laughed softly, her eyes dwelling upon him lovingly.</p>

<p>“Without your lunch or your dinner? That would be
too much. No; if you come and I am not here, leave
some message for me,” she looked round; “write me a
word, and put it under this big stone by the tree there.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “But you will come, if not in
the morning, in the afternoon—sometime! Remember, I
am to see your guardian to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “But do you remember, too, that I
am not my own master, Lord Neville—that I belong to
the public.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Miss Marlowe?” he said, retorting the formality
upon her. “I was under the impression that you
belonged to me!”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” she murmured, with sweet surrender, as he
held her in his arms.</p>

<p>“We’ve forgotten one part of the ceremony,” he said.
“People when they are engaged give each other a ring.
I wasn’t conceited enough to think that you’d listen to
me, or I would have brought one.”</p>

<p>“Have mine,” she said. Then, suddenly, she disengaged
her hand, and held it up, and swiftly drew from her
finger a quaint old silver ring. “See,” she said, the color
stealing into her face. “Will you have that?”</p>

<p>“Will I?” he said, taking it, hand and all.</p>

<p>“What a small hand you have,” she said, laughing
softly. “It is too large for your little finger; you had
better give it back to me.”</p>

<p>“It will be a bad day for me when I do,” he said, grimly,
“for I shall be limp and cold.”</p>

<p>“Or faithless,” she said, with a smile.</p>

<p>Then, before he could retort, she touched his lips with
hers, murmured his name, and was gone.</p>

<p>He watched her until the slight, girlish figure had vanished,
then went slowly to his horse, mounted, and rode
slowly away.</p>

<p>A minute or so afterward a lady and gentleman came
out from among the trees. The gentleman was Spenser
Churchill, the lady—Lady Grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>He wore his usual bland, benevolent smile, intensified, if
anything, as he looked after the disappearing horseman,
but Lady Grace was white almost to pallor, and stood
biting her under lip, and breathing heavily.</p>

<p>“What a charming pastoral!” he said, with his smooth,
oily laugh; “Adam and Eve, or Edwin and Angelina, in
Goldsmith’s poem—you know it, dear Lady Grace?—were
never more poetical or touching! Really, one cannot help
feeling grateful to the happy chance which enabled me to
be a witness of so moving and charming a scene.”</p>

<p>“Chance!” she said, and her voice sounded thick and
forced. “You knew that they would be here when you
asked me to come!” and she shot a glance of scorn and
hate at him.</p>

<p>“I, my dear lady! Now, how was that possible? Do
you think our enamored Cecil would confide his appointments
to me? And not having the inestimable privilege
of knowing the lady——”</p>

<p>“She is the actress—the girl we saw last night!” she
muttered, between her teeth; “an actress—a painted——”</p>

<p>“Was she painted? Yes, I daresay! I am, alas! rather
near-sighted,” he said, smiling as he recalled the youthful
bloom of Doris’ sweet face. “Ah! yes, I daresay! But
perhaps our dear Cecil is near-sighted, too! At any rate,
he seems very—ah—very far gone, does he not?”</p>

<p>“He is mad!” she almost hissed.</p>

<p>“You think, then, that he—ah—means this quite seriously?
You know so much more of the world than I,
dear lady!—you think he would marry this interesting
young creature?”</p>

<p>A light of hateful hope—such a light as shamed her
womanhood—flashed for a moment in Lady Grace’s eyes;
then as it died out she said, moodily, scornfully:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he is mad enough for that! Oh, yes, he
would—even—marry her!”</p>

<p>“In-deed! Really! How charming! So romantic!”
pursued Spenser Churchill. “The future Marchioness of
Stoyle an actress, a provincial actress! Clever, oh, certainly,
and beautiful—ahem!—well, with her paint and
powder, of course; but provincial, quite! And the future
marchioness! Let me see, when was the marquisate
created?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>His smooth, suave speech almost frenzied her.</p>

<p>“Why do you exasperate me?” she exclaimed, between
her teeth, and turning upon him. “Why have you
brought me here? To laugh at me, to mock me with this—this
scandalous scene? You know he will marry her,
unless——”</p>

<p>“Unless?” he said, softly. “Unless an accident happens.
And accidents do happen—alas!—so often in this
unsatisfactory, disappointing world.”</p>

<p>She watched his face eagerly, with a faint glimmer of
hope on her face, which was still pale and eloquent of the
fierce jealousy which racked and tore her.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she demanded, half-angrily,
half-pleadingly.</p>

<p>He smiled unctuously.</p>

<p>“‘’Twixt the cup and the lip.’ The old, old adage,
dear Lady Grace. These young people, in the full flush
of their mutual passion——”</p>

<p>She bit her lip till two red spots showed where the
white, even teeth had pressed.</p>

<p>“Doubtless think that their path to happiness is quite
plain and smooth. Alas! I fear they will find that the
road is stony and difficult. It is a pity, a thousand pities!
It is so sweet to see two hearts that beat as one——”</p>

<p>“Cease!” she said, as if she could endure his soft, mocking
voice no longer. “What will you do? What can you
do? He is mad and—and headstrong. How can you
prevent——” She stopped suddenly, and, stooping,
picked up something from the grass.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said. “Treasure-trove! What is it? A
broken sixpence? No! A ring—the ring!”</p>

<p>She held it almost at arm’s length, as if it were some
noxious reptile, then with a gesture of scorn and hate, she
raised her hand as if to throw the ring from her; but instantly
he seized her arm, and his soft, fat hand slid
down until it had reached and secured the ring.</p>

<p>“Dear me, dear me!” he murmured, as he held it up.
“How sorry he will be, how——” He stopped suddenly,
and his eyes seemed riveted to the ring; then, as he became
aware of Lady Grace’s fixed gaze, the benevolent
smile returned to his face. “Actually lost it a few minutes
after she had given it to him! Now, some superstitious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
persons would call that a bad omen. Are you superstitious,
dear Lady Grace?”</p>

<p>“Give it to me; let me throw it——” she said, with
malignant intensity.</p>

<p>He held it out of her reach, surveying her with smiling
scrutiny.</p>

<p>“No, really you must not. Poor Cecil——” He
stopped suddenly, and the expression of his face changed.
His quick ears had caught the sound of a horse’s hoofs.</p>

<p>Touching her arm, he signed to her to follow him, and
slid back behind the trees. She followed him, and, looking
over her shoulder, saw Lord Cecil galloping toward
them.</p>

<p>He cleared the hedge, and, dropping from the horse,
walked quickly to the spot where they had stood, and commenced
to search in the grass with anxious eagerness.
He went down on his knees, and examined every inch of
the spot where Doris and he had sat, groped along the
bank where they had stood, and hunted every likely spot.</p>

<p>They could see his anxious face, hear his half-muttered
ejaculations of disappointment, and Spenser Churchill,
with the ring in his hand, smiled sweetly.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">TO WED AN ACTRESS.</p>


<p>The ring was nowhere to be seen! Full of pain and
remorse, Lord Cecil was obliged to admit to himself
that it was gone beyond recovery; he might search for
a week, a month, and not find it, for it might have
dropped off his finger and fallen at any spot between
the tree and the brook.</p>

<p>“My darling’s ring!” he murmured aloud, so that the
two listeners could hear him where they stood concealed;
“my darling’s ring! I would give all the Stoyle jewels
to get it back!”</p>

<p>Then he mounted slowly, and with many a backward
glance, as if he hoped that even at the last moment he
might get a glimpse of it shining among the grass, he
rode off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Then the thought of his happiness rose as a tide and
swept away his distress; he had lost the ring, but Doris—beautiful,
sweet Doris—was still his!</p>

<p>It seemed too wonderful, too good to be true, and
he recalled every word she had spoken, every glance
of her love-lit eyes, that he might impress them on his
memory.</p>

<p>The air seemed full of her; the birds seemed to sing
her name: “Doris, Doris Marlowe;” all the earth, clad
in its bright spring colors, was smiling a reflection of
the delirious joy that burnt like a flame in his heart.</p>

<p>She was so beautiful! He tried to think of some of
the girls that he had known, that he might compare
them with her; but they all seemed insipid and colorless
beside the intense, spiritual loveliness of Doris,
with her deep, melting eyes, and grave, clear brows. And
she was not only beautiful, but a genius. Every word
she spoke was lifted out of the region of commonplace
by her marvelous voice, with its innumerable changes
of expression. The touch of her small, smooth hand
lingered about him; yet, the shy kiss of the warm lips
burned upon his brow.</p>

<p>What had he done to deserve so great, so overwhelming
a happiness? And as he asked himself the question
Cecil Neville’s face grew grave, and a pang shot through
his heart, a pang of remorse—and of shame—for some
of the follies of his past life.</p>

<p>Doris was worthy of the best and noblest man in
England, and he——! He set his teeth and breathed
hard. He had laughed at love, had smiled almost contemptuously
at passion, and now he felt that this was
the only thing worth living for, and that rather than
lose his darling he would ride his mare at the stone
wall before him and break his neck.</p>

<p>Then he thought of the marquis and his own position.
What would the marquis say? He laughed grimly as he
pictured the scene before him. He could imagine the
marquis’ cold, haughty face turning to ice and steel as
he listened, and the cutting, smiling voice bidding him
to marry his actress and go to the devil.</p>

<p>He was entirely dependent on the marquis; was in
debt as heavily as even the heir to such a title and estates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
could be. What would the marquis do when he,
Lord Cecil, told him that he could not marry Lady
Grace, because he was going to marry—an actress?</p>

<p>“I wish to Heaven I were anything but what I am,”
he said to himself, with a sigh. “If I were only capable
of earning my own living, a barrister, or a doctor, or an
artist, or something, I could make a home for my
darling then, but I am simply a useless, worthless being,
who happens, unfortunately, to be the next-of-kin to the
Marquis of Stoyle!”</p>

<p>What should he do, if the marquis turned him adrift?
His allowance would cease, his creditors would become
pressing—he would be ruined; and he would have to
wait until the marquis died before he could make Doris
his wife.</p>

<p>The thought was gall and wormwood. Much as he
disliked his uncle, Cecil Neville was not the man to
wish for his death. The marquis might live forever, if
only Cecil could marry his darling.</p>

<p>“If he only had a heart in his bosom, instead of a
flint, and could see her!” he thought, as he rode on; “or
if I were only a barrister or an artist, or anything that
earns money enough to make my darling my wife!”</p>

<p>He was in no hurry to reach the Towers; it was far
pleasanter to be alone, to think over his happiness, and
he made a wide circuit, bringing Polly into the stable-yard
just before the dressing-bell rang.</p>

<p>And, after all his thinking, this was the result: That
he must try somehow to win the marquis’ consent to the
marriage.</p>

<p>He had intended going to the theatre; to feast his
eyes and ears upon his beautiful love, but—with a pang—he
resolved to dine and spend the evening at the
Towers, and after dinner he would tell the marquis.
Perhaps the old port would soften the old man’s heart!
Anyhow, he would tell him.</p>

<p>As he passed through the hall he almost ran against
Spenser Churchill, who was coming out of the marquis’
apartments.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear Cecil!” he murmured, with a benevolent
smile, “just got back? What a lovely evening! Have
you enjoyed your ride? Did you notice the sunset?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Quite a Leader! You know those beautiful pictures
Leader paints, all crimson and mauve?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil nodded and strode up the stairs to his
rooms.</p>

<p>When he came down into the drawing-room, Lady
Grace was seated at the piano, playing softly, and she
glanced up at him with a smile.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing with yourself all day,
Lord Neville?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve just been loafing about,” he said, carelessly;
“and you?”</p>

<p>“I am ashamed to say that I haven’t been outside the
grounds,” she replied. “Mr. Churchill and I have been
botanizing in the gardens. I told him that we really
ought to do something in the way of exploring the
neighborhood, but I could not induce him to go outside
the gates. Are you going to the theatre to-night?” she
asked, innocently.</p>

<p>He started and bent over the music.</p>

<p>“Not to-night,” he said.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” she said. “I myself should like to
go and see that girl play Juliet again; it was wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said in his curt way.</p>

<p>“Yes, she played it so remarkably well. But I’m afraid
a second night would spoil the impression, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I daresay,” he said.</p>

<p>Then the bell rang, and he gave her his arm and
took her into dinner.</p>

<p>All through the elaborate meal she seemed in the
best and brightest of spirits, and her sallies of well-bred
merriment called a smile even to the face of the marquis.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil noticed that he was less bitter than usual,
and that he refrained from making the sneering and contemptuous
remarks with which he usually adorned the
conversation.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill, too, appeared in his most benevolent
and amiable mood, and grew quite pathetic as he
talked of his pet charity for distressed chimney sweeps.</p>

<p>The dessert came, and then Lady Grace took up her
fan and left the room, and Spenser Churchill, after a
single glass of claret, rose, and saying: “Don’t let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
disturb you two; I am going to ask Lady Grace for
some music,” glided out of the room.</p>

<p>The moment had arrived for Lord Cecil’s announcement,
and as he filled his glass, his face grew set and
grave.</p>

<p>The marquis, instead of rising, seemed to linger over
his wine, and leaned back in his chair with a thoughtful
air. Once he glanced at Lord Cecil curiously.</p>

<p>“Have you heard the news from Ireland, Cecil?” he
said.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil started, and set down his glass.</p>

<p>“No, sir. I have not seen the papers.”</p>

<p>“I was not alluding to the papers,” said the marquis,
with a trace of his cold sneer. “I rarely read them;
there is plenty of fiction in the library. But I have heard
from my agent in Connemara. The country is very unsettled.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Lord Cecil absently; he had his own
ideas about Ireland, and they would probably have
much astonished the marquis, who was a Tory of the
old and thorough-going sort. But Lord Cecil was not
thinking of Ireland, but of Doris Marlowe.</p>

<p>“I imagine you know that I—I suppose I ought to
say ‘we’—have a great deal of property there?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil nodded.</p>

<p>“I suppose so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the marquis, glancing at him from the corners
of his cold, keen eyes. “You don’t take much interest
in the matter—at present. But you will be marquis
very soon, and then——” he laughed. “I don’t envy you
your Irish property!”</p>

<p>“I am in no hurry to possess it, sir,” said Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“I daresay not.”</p>

<p>“But I think the people have some reason for what
they are doing.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” assented the marquis, drily. “You view
the business from the patriotic side.”</p>

<p>“I sympathize with the people,” said Lord Neville,
firmly.</p>

<p>The marquis poured out a glass of wine and smiled
coldly.</p>

<p>“Yes—you are young,” he said. “But I’ll admit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
thing wants looking into, and I’m too old to undertake
the inspection.”</p>

<p>Lord Neville raised his head. He did not want to
talk about Ireland, but about Doris Marlowe. And now,
he thought, was the time. The old port stood beside
them, the door was closed. Lady Grace and Spenser
Churchill were in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>He looked at the cold, haughty face and plunged at
his task.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t go into the Irish question to-night,
sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said the marquis, leaning back.</p>

<p>“No,” said Lord Cecil, quietly; “I have a personal
matter I wish to speak to you about.”</p>

<p>The marquis eyed him calmly and patiently.</p>

<p>“Personal matters claim first attention. What is it?
Is it money?”</p>

<p>“I want your consent to my marriage,” said Lord
Cecil.</p>

<p>If he had expected the marquis to express surprise
by word or gesture he was disappointed.</p>

<p>“Your marriage?” he said, quietly. “You intend
taking my advice, I see. You are wise; Lady Grace is
desirable in every way. I’d marry her myself, if I were
younger.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil colored, but he did not flinch.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“That I am not younger?” put in the marquis, with
a sardonic smile.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I’m sorry for that, if youth would make
you any happier, my lord,” said Lord Neville, and he
spoke sincerely. The marquis eyed him keenly. “But
it is not Lady Grace, sir. I think her a most beautiful
and charming lady, of whom I am quite and entirely
unworthy.”</p>

<p>“For once I agree with you,” was the caustic comment.</p>

<p>Lord Neville inclined his head.</p>

<p>“But there is another reason why I cannot venture to
ask Lady Grace to be my wife. I do not love her.”</p>

<p>The marquis smiled.</p>

<p>“I thought it was out of fashion to be in love with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
your wife; forgive me, I have been outside the world so
long. Pray go on.”</p>

<p>“And I love another lady.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” came the cold response. There was no
surprise, scarcely a trace even of displeasure, but the
keen eyes glittered like those of an eagle as they rested
on his handsome, manly face. “Don’t you think it would
have saved both of us some trouble and many words
if you had mentioned this rather important fact when
we were discussing the question the other night?”</p>

<p>Lord Neville smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“I did not know it myself,” he replied; “I had not
met the young lady.”</p>

<p>“Ah, love at first sight!” said the marquis. “Interesting,
but rather imprudent. You have known her, and
loved her, and want to marry her, all in—how many
days is it?”</p>

<p>Lord Neville colored.</p>

<p>“I seem to have known her for years,” he said, almost
to himself.</p>

<p>“And may I ask—I don’t desire to appear inquisitive—who
this young lady is? I didn’t know that you had
visited any of the people here. Do I know her?”</p>

<p>“I think not, sir,” said Lord Neville. “Her name is
Doris Marlowe.”</p>

<p>“Doris Marlowe,” repeated the marquis; “a pretty
name. No, I don’t know it. There is no county family
hereabouts, that I remember, of the name of Marlowe.”</p>

<p>“She is not a member of a county family; she is an
actress,” said Lord Neville.</p>

<p>He looked up steadily, expecting to see the cold,
haughty face break into an expression of rage, fury,
scorn; but there was not the least emotion displayed on
the thin, curled lips and glittering eyes.</p>

<p>“An actress; really! Dear me! This is very—entertaining!
I was under the impression that only callow
schoolboys ever fell in love with actresses. I should have
thought—pray forgive me—that you were too old, if not
too sensible, to be guilty of such a <i>gaucherie</i>.”</p>

<p>Lord Neville pressed his foot down upon the Turkey
carpet, and sat himself squarely in his chair, in his effort
to command his temper. He had resolved that nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
the marquis should say should rouse him to anger or
to retaliation.</p>

<p>“An actress! I don’t think the Stoyles have ever
had an actress in the family; and some of us have gone
pretty low down for our wives, too!”</p>

<p>Lord Neville bit his lip.</p>

<p>“If you knew Miss Marlowe, sir, I think you would
scarcely consider that I was condescending in asking
her to marry me.”</p>

<p>The marquis stared at him as if he were some curious
specimen, worthy of calm and careful consideration.</p>

<p>“I will take your word for that! At any rate, I won’t
venture to contradict you; but you must permit me to
express my satisfaction that Fate has spared me to that
extent! I have no desire to add an actress to my list of
acquaintances.”</p>

<p>Lord Neville inclined his head.</p>

<p>“This is exactly what I expected you to say, sir,” he
said, quietly; “but I considered it my duty to tell you,
and to ask your consent, as I should have asked my
father’s, had he been living.”</p>

<p>“Thanks; you are very considerate,” said the marquis,
with a fine sneer; “and do not mind me! Pray unbosom
yourself! Treat me as if I were your father, and
dilate upon the lady’s charms. Of course she is beautiful.”</p>

<p>“She is very beautiful,” said Lord Neville, quietly.</p>

<p>—“And clever! Quite a genius, in fact, and equally,
of course, pure and innocent as the driven snow.”</p>

<p>The words—the tone—almost maddened Lord Cecil.
His face crimsoned, then went pale, and his eyes burnt
fiercely as they met the keen, sardonic gaze.</p>

<p>“She is clever! She is a genius! Yes!” he said, controlling
himself by a great effort. “She will be, or would
have been famous. As to her innocence and purity, she
has been brought up and carefully guarded by a man,
against whom and herself the tongue of scandal has not
dared even to hint a word.”</p>

<p>“In—deed! You are singularly fortunate!” came the
scornful response.</p>

<p>Lord Neville sprang to his feet, a half audible oath
wrung from him in his torture; but the marquis waved
his thin, white, clawlike hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“Pray sit down. We had better endeavor to discuss
this matter quietly. If she is an actress, that is no reason
why you should treat me to dramatic attitudes.
Pray be calm! I have no doubt you believe all you say,
I am quite convinced of it. We’ll agree that she is everything
that is beautiful and innocent and talented, and
that you are very much in love with her——” and he
laughed, such a laugh of taunting scorn and contempt as
might have been echoed in Tophet.</p>

<p>Lord Neville sank into his chair again.</p>

<p>“And you propose to marry her?” said the marquis,
after sipping his wine. “To marry her! Now that surprises
me! How fashions alter! In my day that is the
last thing we should have done.”</p>

<p>Lord Neville’s face darkened.</p>

<p>“Even in your day, my lord, all men were not scoundrels,”
he said, grimly.</p>

<p>“No,” said the marquis, delighted at having driven him
to retort. “No; there were some fools—even in my
day!”</p>

<p>“You shall call me what you please, sir.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, what else can I call you? Even you
will not expect me to applaud such a step as you propose
taking. You are a Neville, you will be the Marquis
of Stoyle, a peer of the three kingdoms: you will get, or
you would have got, the Garter; and you propose to marry—an
actress! An actress! If there is any man in England
who would not call you a fool, I should like to see
him; I should like to see him very much, indeed. Why,
my dear fellow, depend upon it, no one thinks you more
decidedly a fool than the girl herself.”</p>

<p>“By Heaven, if you only knew her!” broke from Lord
Neville’s parched lips.</p>

<p>The marquis laughed.</p>

<p>“Thanks, again. But you’ll excuse me, I trust! An
actress! Come, I’m not a betting man—now, but I will
wager you a hundred pounds to five that before two
months after you have been married you will admit to me
that I was right and that you were a very great fool, indeed!”</p>

<p>“I take you, sir,” said Lord Neville, grimly, and he
drew out his pocketbook and carefully jotted down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
bet. The old man’s eyes shone with a swift approval; it
was a touch worthy of himself.</p>

<p>“And I’ll make you another that in the same period the
girl herself will be as sorry that she married you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t take that,” said Lord Neville, coldly. “For,
considering the blood that runs in my veins, any
woman’s chance of happiness as my wife is a small one.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">AN ACCEPTED OFFER.</p>


<p>The effect of this retort upon the marquis was fearful!
His face, pale at all times, went livid, his eyes gleamed
like ardent coals, his teeth came together with a click, and
he drooped as if he had been struck; then in a moment or
two he recovered himself and made an elaborate bow.</p>

<p>“Fairly hit,” he said, and his voice was very low and
sharp. “Very well done, indeed. But you forgot when
you taunted me with the unhappiness of my own married
life, that you were admitting that I spoke with experience.”</p>

<p>Lord Neville flushed.</p>

<p>“By Heaven, sir,” he said, quietly, “you drove me too
hard. I know little or nothing of your married life—I
scarcely thought of it when I spoke——”</p>

<p>The marquis waved his hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t spoil it by an apology,” he said, quietly. “You
struck home and should be satisfied. My marriage was
almost as great a mistake as yours will be. Almost, not
quite. It ruined my life; if by a little trouble I could
have saved you from a like experience, I should have
been glad to have done so; but I am not prepared to take
much trouble. We will, therefore, if you please, consider
that you have made up your mind to marry this girl from
the gutter—don’t look so fierce; a girl who is of no family
is from the gutter—the pavement!—that you have
made up your mind to become the laughing-stock of all
your friends, old and young; to chain yourself to a woman
who will, while she lives, be pointed and stared at as ‘the
actress,’ that you are contented to leave the society to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
which your birth and position entitle you, and sink into
grim solitude or the companionship of people of her
class. We will take all this for granted. And now, what
do you expect me to do, if I may ask?”</p>

<p>“To request me to leave this house, to discontinue my
allowance, and to cut me from henceforth,” said Lord
Neville, promptly but calmly.</p>

<p>The marquis smiled.</p>

<p>“Y—es,” he said, nodding, “that is my duty forcibly and
concisely. This is what I ought to do; but all my life I
have never done what I ought to have done, and have always
done what I ought not. You are welcome to remain
at the Towers as long as you please.”</p>

<p>Lord Neville looked at him with faint surprise, and the
marquis sipped his wine slowly.</p>

<p>“I shall double your allowance, and, as to cutting you,
that would be inconvenient and troublesome, not to say
vulgar. Of course I shall keep to my resolve respecting
the property, that will go to Lady Grace as I said.”</p>

<p>Lord Neville’s face flushed.</p>

<p>“She is welcome to it—quite welcome to it,” he said at
once; “I am glad that it should be so. I—I think you
have acted very generously to me, and I thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>The marquis inclined his head, a faint smile hovering
about his thin lips.</p>

<p>“You might be able to marry upon your allowance
doubled, as I propose,” he said. “You would not be
very rich, but it might do.”</p>

<p>“It will be quite sufficient,” said Lord Neville, as yet
unrecovered from his surprise.</p>

<p>“I shall not live very long, I hope—though, by the
way, I should like to live long enough to win that five
pounds of you”—Lord Neville smiled—“and then you
will have the estates, such as they are.”</p>

<p>“I ask you to believe me, that I am in no hurry. I do
not wish, and never have wished for your death,” and his
face flushed.</p>

<p>The marquis waved his hand.</p>

<p>“Thanks, very much! But to return: I presume that
you have not the slightest doubt of the stability of your
feelings? You are sure that you won’t change your mind—your
heart, I should have said?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“Quite certain,” replied Lord Neville, Doris’ face rising
before him as he spoke. “My happiness is bound up
in Miss Marlowe; I shall never cease to love her.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the marquis. “Of course, you want
to be married at once? Oh, I have no objection; it is a
matter of perfect indifference to me, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“Then your kindness and liberality are all the more
marked, sir,” said Lord Neville. “I wish I could convince
you of my gratitude; it is sufficient to make me forget—almost—all
the hard things you have said.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the marquis, “gratitude is a fine sentiment—very
fine. But rather hollow and shadowy. If I were to
ask you to do something, for instance, to prove this beautiful
sentiment!” he sneered, as a finish to the sentence.</p>

<p>Lord Neville looked up.</p>

<p>“I wish you would!” he said. “I should like to prove
my sincerity, sir.”</p>

<p>The marquis looked round the room with a smile of
idle amusement.</p>

<p>“Really,” he said, “there is nothing I can think of asking
you to do, excepting to pass the wine, and that does
not entail much sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“I was not jesting, sir,” said Lord Neville, gravely.
“My offer was made in all sincerity.”</p>

<p>“Really? Dear me, I wish I could think of something,
Ah!” he stopped and looked at Lord Neville’s attentive
face keenly, sarcastically. “What do you say if I
ask you to go over to Ireland for me?”</p>

<p>Lord Neville’s face grew grave, and the marquis leaned
back and laughed with grim satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You see! Gratitude’s a very fine thing—to talk
about!”</p>

<p>Lord Neville flushed.</p>

<p>“You misunderstand my silence,” he said, quietly. “If
you mean by going to Ireland for you, I’m to take side
with the landlords”—stopped—“I could not join in the
oppression of those poor people, my lord, even to prove
my own sincerity.”</p>

<p>The marquis toyed with his fruit knife.</p>

<p>“Charmingly put, my dear Cecil; quite fit for a political
platform. But you misunderstand me. I know nothing
of the question, and care less; I hate and detest politics;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
they bore me, they always did. All I want is this:
I am told that my agent is a rogue, who has made himself
rich by grinding down the tenants; I am also told that
he is the most merciful and upright of men. I’m rather
curious to know—well, scarcely curious, perhaps—which
account is true. Will you go and find out? I don’t think
you can call that oppressing the people.”</p>

<p>Lord Neville looked up with quiet eagerness.</p>

<p>“Certainly, I will go, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>The marquis inclined his head.</p>

<p>“Mind, I don’t care a brass farthing whether you go or
refuse; I don’t care about anything; and it is very likely
that after you are gone to-morrow morning I shall have
ceased to remember what you have gone about.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning?” said Lord Neville, almost inaudibly.
To-morrow morning! and his appointment
with Doris, his interview with her guardian!</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the marquis, carelessly, but shooting a
glance, half-scornful, half-amused, at the grave face. “If
you go at all it must be at once! Some one should have
started to-night! The man will collect the rents in a
day or two; he should be stopped—or the other thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lord Neville, absently.</p>

<p>Go without seeing Doris! Without gaining her guardian’s
consent. His heart throbbed with a dull ache.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course you see that! The early train would
enable you to catch the Irish mail at Sandstone Junction——Ah,
I see,” and he laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>Lord Neville looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>“You want to see Miss Barlow——”</p>

<p>“Marlowe,” said Lord Neville.</p>

<p>“Pardon. Marlowe. To tell her that the wicked uncle
has proved less black than he is painted——”</p>

<p>Lord Neville smiled.</p>

<p>“Is that unnatural?”</p>

<p>“By no means; but permit me to suggest that you can
write to her. I merely suggest it.”</p>

<p>Lord Neville rose with a quiet air of determination.</p>

<p>“What time does the early train start, sir?” he said.</p>

<p>The marquis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Parkins will tell you,” he said, carelessly. “You
mean to go, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>The marquis laughed.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly give me that despatch box?” he said.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil brought it to him, and the marquis took out
some papers.</p>

<p>“Here are the papers,” he said, languidly. “I haven’t
read them all; you can bore yourself over them in the
train. And will you favor me by accepting this toward
the expenses,” and he laid a roll of uncounted notes on
the table.</p>

<p>Cecil took them up and examined them.</p>

<p>“There is more than enough here,” he said, quietly.</p>

<p>“There is never more than enough money,” said the
marquis. “If you think there is too much, you can distribute
the surplus among the poor people with whom you
sympathize.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can do that—and will!”</p>

<p>“As you like. I will say ‘good-night;’ by the way, I
should say ‘good-by,’ for you may be shot!” he added, as
calmly as if he were saying, “It may rain.”</p>

<p>“I am not coward enough to be afraid of that, or fool
enough to think it likely!” said Lord Cecil, as carelessly.
“Good-night, sir,” and he held the door open for him.</p>

<p>As he did so the marquis raised his eyelids and shot a
glance at the handsome face; then, with a bow and a cold
smile, passed out.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil went up to his own room, and, lighting a
cigar, paced up and down, thinking deeply.</p>

<p>It was marvelous that the marquis should have acted
as he had done! Double his allowance! He would be
able to marry at once, instead of waiting. Marry Doris
at once! The blood beat in a tumult at his heart; then a
dull weight seemed to fall upon him as he remembered
his debts. But he thrust the incubus from him; something
might be done respecting them, some arrangement
made. At any rate, he would have an income large
enough to marry on, and Doris——! He puffed at his
cigar fiercely, and called up a vision of the lovely face,
and tried to imagine the expression the deep, dark, melting
orbs would wear when he told her. Then, as he reflected
that he should not see her on the morrow, he sighed.</p>

<p>“It almost seems as if my darling had some presentiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
that we should not meet,” he said to himself.
“What will she say when she finds that I am not there
and goes to the stone for the letter?”</p>

<p>Then he sat down to the table to write it. It was not
easy, for he wanted to say enough to cover ten pages;
but at last he wrote a few lines only:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Darling</span>:—While you are reading this I shall be on my
way to Ireland—with my heart in Barton meadows. I can’t tell
you in a letter all that has happened; only this, that, as he himself
put it, the wicked marquis is not so bad as he is painted!
Doris, when I come back, it will be to ask you to be my wife—not
in a year or two, but soon, soon! I’m a bad hand at writing
letters, and I could not, if I tried, tell you how I love you, or
how I wish I were near you, to see and hear you, my beautiful
angel! Ever yours,</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Cecil</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>P. S.—I owe my uncle something, for he has behaved with
unusual kindness, and this journey to Ireland is the only way
in which he will let me pay him. I will tell you all about it when
I come back.</p>
</div>

<p>He sighed over the unsatisfactory epistle and closed it;
then reopened the letter and caught up his pen to tell her
of the loss of the ring and ask her to look for it; but he
hesitated, and put the letter back in the envelope with the
sentence unwritten. Then he put on his coat and walked
to the meadows. The night was dark, and he had to light
a match to enable him to find the stone beneath the trees,
but he found it and concealed his letter, and then, after
standing for a few moments and looking round him
dreamily, casting up the vision of Doris, he turned and
made his way back to the Towers.</p>

<p>The marquis had gone to his room, as was customary
with him; his valet exchanged his master’s dress coat for
a velvet dressing-gown, and the old man lay back in the
chair looking at the fire with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>The room was magnificently furnished, but in rather a
subdued tone, which was rendered almost sombre by the
heavy curtains that screened the window and a greater
portion of the walls.</p>

<p>Against the deep purple of the hangings the clear,
sharp-cut face with its distinct pallor looked almost like
that of a dead man’s, and only the steel-like glitter of the
eyes spoke of the vitality which lingered in the body, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
burned in the spirit of the most honorable, the Marquis
of Stoyle.</p>

<p>Presently there came a soft tap at the door, and in response
to the marquis’ “come in,” Spenser Churchill entered.</p>

<p>If anything his smooth, innocent face looked more
benevolent and charitable than usual, and the smile he
bent upon the hard, cold face upturned to him was like
that of a man whose sole delight is in doing good to his
fellowmen.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said—or rather purred.</p>

<p>The marquis waved his hand to a chair, and Spenser
Churchill dropped softly into it, and leaned back, his
eyes on the ceiling, his fat hands clasped on his knee.</p>

<p>“You were right, you spoke nothing but the truth; the
fool is in earnest.”</p>

<p>“Dear Cecil,” purred Spenser Churchill.</p>

<p>“He is so much in love that he bore all the insults that I
could heap upon him—no! I wrong him. He struck
home once!” and he smiled a strange smile.</p>

<p>“And he means to marry her?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the marquis, with a cruel sneer; “he is
even fool enough for that.”</p>

<p>“Dear Cecil!” murmured Spenser Churchill again.
“How delightful, how refreshing it is, in this practical,
stupid life, to find——”</p>

<p>“And he will marry her, unless this scheme of yours
answers,” said the marquis, breaking in upon the smooth
voice.</p>

<p>“And you doubled his income?”</p>

<p>“I did,” said the marquis.</p>

<p>“And he will go to Ireland? To-morrow?”</p>

<p>“He will, to-morrow,” said the marquis, watching the
sleek, false face.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s very good of him,” murmured Spenser
Churchill; “very good, most charming and nice. To go
to Ireland on the very day he has arranged a meeting with
that beautiful girl. Now——”</p>

<p>“Is she so beautiful?” asked the marquis, who seemed
to take the unctuous words as meaningless and not worth
listening to. “I suppose she must be. He has seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
many pretty women, many clever ones. What has caught
him? What is she like?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill shot a sidelong glance at him.</p>

<p>“The usual thing, my dear marquis,” he said, softly.
“Just the usual thing! They make those face powders
wonderfully well now—wonderfully!”</p>

<p>The marquis smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“The fool, to be caught by a painted vixen, old
enough——I suppose she is old, eh?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, of course! A young girl wouldn’t have had
the tact to catch him so easily. And he has written to
her, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Spenser Churchill; “and gone to post his
letter under the stone. The romance is simply charming!
Charming!”</p>

<p>The marquis eyed the fire thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I am almost inclined to let him marry her,” he said, in
a low voice. “I should enjoy the misery that would follow!
Yes, I’m half inclined——” and an evil light
flashed from his eyes.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill watched him behind the mask of a
benevolent smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” he murmured; “we really must not, we
really must not let dear Cecil ruin himself. My dear
marquis, we should not sleep; our consciences——”</p>

<p>The marquis broke in with a cold, sardonic laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right! After all, it will be more amusing
to thwart him—if we can.”</p>

<p>“If we can,” echoed Spenser Churchill with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t doubt your ability,” said the marquis with
a sneer; “the devil himself could not be a fitter person
for such work. What do you mean to do?” he added,
with a half-contemptuous, half-weary gesture.</p>

<p>“Have you a letter of dear Cecil’s?” said Spenser
Churchill. “I really am half ashamed! It is only the
conviction that I am acting for the dear fellow’s ultimate
good that gives me courage——”</p>

<p>The marquis pointed to a cabinet.</p>

<p>“You will find some letters of his there,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” murmured Spenser Churchill, and he rose
and opened the cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>Then he selected two or three letters, and, smiling and
nodding at the marquis as if they were conspiring to do
some good deed in secret, he went to a davenport and
wrote.</p>

<p>After a few moments he came across the room, and
with his head on one side, a benevolent smile on his innocent
face, he dropped a letter on the marquis’ knee.</p>

<p>The marquis took it up and looked at it with a careless
air, then started.</p>

<p>“Forgery must be very easy,” he said, with a sneer, “or
you must have had a great deal of practice, Spenser.”</p>

<p>“You really think it is like—just a little like?” said
Spenser Churchill, as if he had received high praise for a
virtuous action. “Now, really, you think it is something
of a resemblance?”</p>

<p>“It is so close a forgery that Cecil himself might almost
be persuaded that it is his own.”</p>

<p>“No! Really! But read it, dear marquis! The handwriting
is only of secondary importance; the style of the
letter—eh? What do you say?”</p>

<p>The marquis read the note, and a smile of sardonic
amusement lit up his pallid face.</p>

<p>“Now, please don’t flatter me, tell me your true opinion,
marquis!” purred Spenser Churchill, leaning forward,
and rubbing his hands together.</p>

<p>The marquis tossed the letter to him.</p>

<p>“It is a very good counterfeit,” he said.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill laughed softly.</p>

<p>“I tried to imagine the way in which our dear Cecil
would write, and you think I have succeeded? Poor
Cecil, poor girl! What a hard world it is! Now, why
can’t these interesting young things be permitted to be
happy in their own charming, unsophisticated way? What
a pity it is that one feels bound, in the cause of humanity
and society, to—er—so to speak—put a spoke in their
wheel!” and he stood up and began buttoning his coat.</p>

<p>“You yourself are going to take that letter?” asked the
marquis.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” purred Spenser Churchill. “We mustn’t
confide our nice little plot to a servant.”</p>

<p>“You are taking a great deal of trouble; why?” said
the marquis, eyeing him keenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>Spenser Churchill’s eyes dropped, and a benevolent
smile shone on his smooth face.</p>

<p>“Simply out of regard and affection for you, marquis,
and our dear Cecil, and the house of Stoyle, to which I am
so much attached. Yes, I shall take the letter myself.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the marquis, slowly. Then he looked up.
“I should recommend you to keep clear of Cecil,” he
said, with a sneer. “He’s as strong as an ox and—a Neville.
Seriously, Spenser, if he should get an inkling,
and catch you, I fear you would come off badly. Unless
you are tired of life, you had better keep out of his way.”</p>

<p>“No, I am not tired of life,” said Spenser Churchill.
“But I shall take my pretty little letter myself. Adieu!”
and he nodded, and smiled himself out of the room.</p>

<p class="center">A BROKEN TRYST.</p>


<p>Doris went home with her heart beating, every nerve
throbbing with the thrill of a woman’s first love; and it
was not until she had her hand upon the door that she
fully realized the task that lay before her.</p>

<p>She had to tell Jeffrey. To tell him that all his lifelong
plans for her were shattered and cast to the winds;
that, just at the moment of success, success won by hard,
persistent work and untiring effort, on his part and hers,
she, Doris Marlowe, who was to have been the actress of
the day, was going to retire from the stage forever.</p>

<p>She scarcely realized it herself yet, and yet she knew
that it must be. The future wife of the heir to the marquisate
of Stoyle could not be permitted to remain an
actress, to be gazed at by a nightly mob, to be cheered
or hissed by a public audience. She sighed as the thought
came home to her, not for herself, and the sacrifice of
fame, but for Jeffrey. It would be hard for him to bear,
very, very hard; but she did not doubt that he would give
his consent. As she had said to Lord Neville, Jeffrey
could not find it in his heart to refuse her anything she
wanted very much, and she did want to marry this handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
young lover, whose simple touch had power to move
her, very much indeed.</p>

<p>She opened the door. Jeffrey was seated at a small
table, covered with papers and old letters. He was bending
over them with an air and attitude of deep abstraction,
and he did not hear her light footfall as she crossed
the room, and laid her small hand rather tremulously
upon his stooping shoulders.</p>

<p>“Doris!” he exclaimed, looking up with a start, and
covering the papers before him with both his thin, gnarled
hands.</p>

<p>“Why, Jeffrey, dear, did I frighten you?” she said
gently. “What are you doing? You look as if you were
trying to write a play!”</p>

<p>He smiled constrainedly and began collecting the papers
and letters in a nervous, hurried fashion.</p>

<p>“I—I have been busy,” he said. “Old papers and—and
letters. Where have you been, and what have you been
doing?”</p>

<p>He did not look at her or he would have seen the color
which suffused her face and noticed the suddenly downcast
eyes.</p>

<p>“I have been to the meadows, Jeffrey. I—I want to
tell you something.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, tying the letters together in a bundle,
and folding up a couple of yellow, time-stained papers.
“What is it? What is the time? I—I have been sitting
here so long that I’ve forgotten.” He looked at his old-fashioned
watch, and rising hastily, put the bundle of letters
in a box that stood on the table. “It is time for the
rehearsal; are you ready? I shall not be a moment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am quite ready; but there is plenty of time,
Jeffrey, and I want to tell you—have you forgotten those
papers? Are you not going to lock them up with the
others,” and she pointed to them.</p>

<p>He snatched them up almost jealously.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said. “I keep them—here!” and he placed
them with a nervous carefulness in a pocket within the
breast of his waistcoat. “I—I meant to show you to-day,
Doris. I have been going to show them to you for—”
he sighed—“years. But I’ve put it off from day to day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
from year to year. They belong to you, and you shall
have them—to-morrow, say to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Doris started slightly. It was to-morrow that Lord
Neville was coming to see Jeffrey; perhaps he would
give them to Lord Neville!</p>

<p>“How well you look this morning,” he said suddenly,
his eyes resting for a moment upon her lovely face with
their old keenness. “Those meadows, as you call them,
must be wonderfully healthy. Where is my hat?”</p>

<p>She got it for him, and as she gave it to him she let
her hand fall lightly upon his arm.</p>

<p>“And don’t you want to hear what I have to tell you,
Jeffrey?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” he said. “What is it? Nothing very important,
I suppose? A new bonnet you’ve seen in the Barton
milliner’s? Well, you can buy it! You can buy all
the bonnets in the window now, if you like!” and he
chuckled grimly. “No more pinching and scraping—though
we’ll be careful still, eh, Doris? We’ll be careful!
Hard-earned money’s too precious to be squandered. Buy
your bonnet, Doris, by all means. Come along!” and he
was across the room and out of the door before she could
summon up courage to stop him.</p>

<p>She would tell him after rehearsal, she thought, with a
sigh; but after rehearsal he came hurrying to her to tell
her that he had arranged to go to the next town on important
business for the manager.</p>

<p>“I shall be back to-night,” he said, in his quick, stern
voice; “in time to take you home, as usual,” and he
touched her forehead with his lips.</p>

<p>“You will be sure to be back to-night, Jeffrey?” she
said, clinging to him for a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he said, hurriedly. “If anything should
prevent me——” He put his hand to his breast thoughtfully,
and his heavy brows knitted with a troubled expression;
then he seemed to shake it off. “But I shall
be back. If by any chance I should lose the train——”</p>

<p>“Jeffrey!”</p>

<p>“I said by any chance only, and it is not likely; but
if I should I will come by the first in the morning. Mrs.
Parkhouse, the dresser, will see you home if I am not
here. Good-by, my child! Play your best to-night! I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
am working for you; stone by stone I am building up the
edifice of your fame——” He stopped, pressed her shoulder
with his thin hand, and was gone.</p>

<p>Doris felt a strange sense of loneliness fall upon her.
It was the first time he had left her for so many hours
that his absence oppressed her for a moment or two with
a sense of helplessness. Then suddenly there flashed
upon her the remembrance of Cecil and his love, and the
oppression vanished. How could she be helpless while
he was so near to love and protect her?</p>

<p>Was it strange that her feet should wander from the
straight road home, to the brook in the meadows? Was
it strange that she should linger on the spot made sacred
to her by her love until the last moment, so that she left
herself barely time to dress and reach the theatre?</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall see him to-night,” she thought; “perhaps
he will come to the cab and say one word, just one
word!” And when she came on, her beautiful eyes wandered
over the crowded house with an eagerness which
she could scarcely conceal.</p>

<p>But he was not there: and he did not come during the
whole evening. She felt that she should know if he were
in the theatre, though she should not be able to see him,
and she knew even before she left the stage door to go
to the cab that she should not see him, and Jeffrey had
not come back!</p>

<p>“You feel tired to-night, Miss Marlowe,” said Mrs.
Parkhouse, as Doris leaned back in the cab, and drew her
cloak round her. “Shall I come home and stay with you
to-night? I dare say you feel lonely without Mr. Jeffrey.”</p>

<p>But Doris would not let her do that.</p>

<p>“I am tired,” she said, “and I feel rather lonely, but
Mr. Jeffrey would laugh at me for being so nervous.
No, you shall not stay.”</p>

<p>She sat up into the night looking at the stars from
the window, which she threw open, for the air was balmy
with the breath of the coming summer; and she tried
to realize all that had happened to her, all that was going
to happen to her.</p>

<p>It was not of the title and rank that were to be hers
she thought, but of Cecil’s love, and she stretched her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
long white arms out toward Barton Towers with a yearning
gesture, murmuring, “My love, my love!”</p>

<p>The morning broke, not brightly and sunnily, but in
fitful gleams glancing through shower clouds; and when
she came downstairs she found a yellow telegram envelope
beside her plate.</p>

<p>It was from Jeffrey, saying that the merest chance he
had spoken of had occurred, and that he had been detained
the night, but that he would catch the eleven o’clock
train, and asking her to meet him.</p>

<p>Her face brightened as she read it. Yes, she would
meet him, and as they walked through the woods from the
station, she would tell him of her strange meeting with
Lord Neville and all that had sprung from it, and then
they both could go and meet Cecil by the brook.</p>

<p>She hurried through a mere pretense of a breakfast,
and putting on her hat and jacket, set out.</p>

<p>The sky had cleared somewhat, and the sun, shining
through the spaces of blue, touched the green leaves with
a dazzling sheen.</p>

<p>As she went toward the meadows, her heart beating
with an anticipatory joy, her mind was hard at work.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, Jeffrey would not so much mind her
giving up the stage and the career for which he had so
carefully prepared her. It was her happiness he had been
seeking—only her happiness, and when he learned that
it was bound up in her love for Cecil Neville, he would
not refuse his consent or throw any obstacle in the way.</p>

<p>Looking at it in this hopeful fashion, she reached a
spot where the footpath branched in two directions—one
led to the brook, the other to the railway station.</p>

<p>She stopped and glanced at the path to the brook wistfully;
perhaps Cecil was already waiting for her. Consulting
her tiny watch—a present from Jeffrey—she saw
that there was just time to go round by way of the brook,
and, with a heightened color and eager eyes, she took the
path that led thither.</p>

<p>“After all,” she murmured, when she reached the bank,
and looked round upon the unbroken solitude; “I might
have waited! He is not here! I dare say he has not
finished his breakfast yet; and yet, if he knew that I was
here——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>She sat down on the bank, and gazed dreamily about
her. The brook babbling at her feet; the branches of the
trees waving solemnly above her head; the very air
seemed eloquent of the lover who had stolen her heart
and absorbed her life, and she fell into a delicious reverie.
Then, suddenly, her eyes fell upon the big round stone at
the foot of the tree, and a smile broke over her face.</p>

<p>“What a foolish, romantic girl he must have thought
me,” she murmured; “as if he would let anything prevent
him coming.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she rose, and, almost mechanically, knelt
down and turned the stone over.</p>

<p>Then, with a start, she woke, for there lay a white envelope.</p>

<p>She took it up and gazed at it, turning it over and over,
a dull, heavy disappointment weighing upon her, and examined
the address, and the elaborate crest stamped on
the back.</p>

<p>“Then it was not so romantic or foolish,” she murmured,
sorrowfully. “He is not coming!”</p>

<p>She sank down upon the bank, and looked before her
with a vacant air, the envelope still unopened. “Not coming!
Not coming!” It was like the announcement of
some terrible calamity.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, hope sprang into her bosom.</p>

<p>“He has written to tell me why he cannot come,” she
said to herself, and the color rushed back into her face.
“Yes, that is it! He has been prevented—his uncle, the
marquis! Something has prevented him, and he has just
written to tell me when he can come, and when I shall
see him.”</p>

<p>She tore the envelope open, and something fell upon
the grass. She leaned forward and picked it up; it was
the old pearl-silver ring she had given to him.</p>

<p>She looked at it, turning it over with a vague aching
sense of disappointment and trouble.</p>

<p>“My ring!” she murmured, “my ring! Now, what
does this mean?” then her face brightened. “Ah, yes, he
has sent it to remind me of yesterday!”</p>

<p>Eagerly she opened the letter, and her lovely eyes
seemed to devour it; but as she read they grew dim and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
hazy, and she swept her hand across them with an impatient
gesture.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t read!” she murmured piteously. “I can’t
read it!” Her hands closed tightly on the thick, smooth
sheet of notepaper, and she set her teeth hard. “I must
be mad—yes, that is it! Let me wait a moment. Now!”
and she bent forward, and, with knitted brows, read it
out word by word, slowly, painfully, like a child reading
a repugnant task.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Marlowe</span>—for I feel that I dare not call you by
the name engraven on my heart, and yet I must, though it is for
the last time! Dear, dear Doris! I am the most wretched and
miserable of men! And yesterday I was the happiest! Doris,
I have seen my uncle and told him all, and he has proved to
me, beyond all question, that it is impossible for me to make you
mine. I can’t tell you all that passed between us; I scarcely
know what I am writing, but the dreadful fact remains that by
making you my wife I should work you nothing but wretchedness
and misery. Don’t ask me to tell you anything more; I cannot!
Try and forget me, Doris! I am not, and never can be, worth a
single thought of yours! I know what you will think, and the
knowledge only adds to my misery. You will think that I value
my worldly prosperity above your love; but I swear it is not so!
I would willingly resign everything—rank, money, position—for
your sake; but there are other reasons. Forgive and forget me,
Doris, or if you still think of me, remember me as one who
wishes himself dead! Good-by—and forever!</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Cecil Neville.</span><br>
</p>

<p>I return your ring. I dare not keep it, having lost you!</p>
</div>

<p>Thrice she read it slowly, carefully, as if she were trying
to learn it by heart; then she rose, and, white as the
stones washed by the brook stood gazing at the broken
and hastily scrawled lines.</p>

<p>“Good-by—and forever!” she murmured. “Good-by—and
forever!”</p>

<p>A wild laugh forced itself from her lips, and she
dropped down on the bank as if she had been felled by a
blow.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A TERRIBLE THREAT.</p>


<p>Half an hour later Jeffrey was making his way along
the footpath through the woods, his thin, bent figure
throwing a fantastic shadow on the tree trunks, as he
walked with his head projected and drooping, his eyes
fixed on the ground. Every now and then he raised his
head, looking about him as if he remembered that he had
asked Doris to meet him; but he almost immediately again
relapsed into his pre-occupied manner. Once he stopped
and took the papers from the pocket in his breast and
looked at them with a deep and thoughtful frown.</p>

<p>“Yes, to-day!” he murmured. “I will tell her to-day!
Why should I be afraid? It will make no difference; she
will be my child still; it will make no difference.” He
took off his hat and wiped his brow and sighed. “Yes,
I’ll tell her to-day. I—I’m not so strong as I was, and
one can’t tell what may happen. If I died before I’d told
her——”</p>

<p>The muttered words stopped suddenly, and he looked
up with a startled air which swiftly changed to one of
fierce anger. A dapper, comfortably-rounded figure stood
before him, with placidly smiling face and serenely benevolent
air.</p>

<p>“Spenser Churchill!” exclaimed Jeffrey hoarsely, his
hands closing with a gesture at once threatening and repressive.</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Flint!” purred Spenser, his head on
one side, his hand extended benignantly. “My dear Mr.
Flint! What a delightful coincidence! After all, nothing
is more true than the rather hackneyed assertion
that the world is a small place.”</p>

<p>Jeffrey, glaring at him fiercely, waved his hand.</p>

<p>“Pass on—pass on!” he panted; “I—I will have nothing
to say to you!”</p>

<p>“Now really, my dear Jeffrey,” murmured Spenser
Churchill remonstratingly, “is it—I put it to you as a
sensible man—is it really worth while to nourish these—er—unchristianlike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
resentments? Look at me——” It
was quite an unnecessary request, for the fierce, deeply-sunken
eyes had never left the smooth, supple face.
“Look at me, my dear Jeffrey. I, too, have had my trials;
but—er—I sink them, I let them drop—I bury them, and
I make it my principle to forget and forgive.”</p>

<p>“Let me pass, you——!” panted Jeffrey, his whole
frame shaking with an effort at self-control.</p>

<p>“To forget and forgive,” repeated the other, as if the
words were a sweet morsel he was turning over his
tongue. “Believe me, dear Jeffrey, that is far, far the
wiser plan.”</p>

<p>“You think so?” said Jeffrey, hoarsely. “You can forget,
Spenser Churchill; I cannot, for it was you who
wronged, I who suffered! So you have forgotten, and
you dared to think that I had done so? That you may
see how well I remember, villain——No, stop!” for
Spenser Churchill had backed a few steps, and glanced
round, as if meditating a retreat. “Stop, Spenser
Churchill, while I remind you why, when the devil sends
you across my path, that it would be wiser for you to
crawl on one side, lest I crush you, you smiling, fawning
reptile! You forget! You forget the life you
ruined! Look on me and remember! I was young,
rich in health and hope, blessed with the love of an honest,
tender-hearted girl, when that devil—your master—the
Marquis of Stoyle, the beast for whom you jackalled,
employed you to entice her from me. You succeeded,
Spenser Churchill, and have forgotten her misery, and
mine; all, save perhaps the sum your master flung you.”</p>

<p>His hands were so near the delicate white throat opposite
him that Spenser Churchill drew his head back
sharply, and turned pale.</p>

<p>“My dear Jeffrey!” he murmured soothingly. “Now,
come, come. Now, really, you know! If any one were
listening—which I am thankful, for your sake, is not the
case—they would gather from your—er—really extravagant
language that I had, like the bad man in a play,
contrived the ruin of the usual virtuous young lady,
whereas I must, in justice to myself, remind you, my
dear Jeffrey, that the young lady in question was only
guilty of the remarkably bad taste of jilting you for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Marquis of Stoyle, who, like an honorable gentleman,
made her his lawful wife and sharer of his exalted rank.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jeffrey, hoarsely. “Because, by no other
means could he get her in his power! Made her his
wife! Yes, that he might crush her the more easily!
Enough, Spenser Churchill!”</p>

<p>“Pardon me! One word more! You appear to have
forgotten that the lady, marchioness as she was, preferred
to return to her first admirer——There, there!”
he broke off, putting up his hand to ward off the threatened
blow; “as you say, it is not worth talking about,
and, as I say, it is as much wiser to forget. The poor
lady is dead, and the child——”</p>

<p>“Is dead, too!” said Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“Is playing ‘Juliet’ at the Theatre Royal, Barton,” put
in Spenser Churchill, smoothly. “Miss Doris Marlowe,
otherwise Lady Mary, daughter of the Most Honorable
the Marquis of Stoyle——”</p>

<p>Jeffrey staggered, and sank trembling on a fallen tree,
great drops of sweat trickling down his white, wrinkled
face.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill took out a cigarette and lit it, smiling
blandly down upon the stricken figure.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, my dear Jeffrey,” he said, pleasantly,
“I am almost inclined to cry, ‘Fie, for shame!’ and
to retort one of the ugly words which you so liberally
applied to me. To afford shelter to the wife of the dear
marquis is one thing, but to steal his child——”</p>

<p>“She—she died!” gasped Jeffrey, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“So it was stated, and so it was believed by all excepting
the gentleman who has the honor to stand before
you.” He laughed unctuously. “I had my suspicions
from the first, and I found them justified when I saw
Miss Doris Marlowe in her charming performance the
other evening, and, on inquiry, found that she was the
daughter of Mr. Jeffrey Flint!”</p>

<p>Jeffrey wiped the sweat from his forehead and opened
his lips, but he seemed deprived of the power of speech.</p>

<p>“You must permit me,” continued the softly mocking
voice, “to congratulate you upon the result of your excellent
training. The young lady is a most talented
actress—most charming! But, my dear Jeffrey, does it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
not occur to you sometimes that it is, to use the vulgar
slang of the day, rather rough upon her? To deprive a
young and helpless girl of her rank and position——”</p>

<p>Jeffrey extended his trembling hands entreatingly.</p>

<p>“Stop—stop!” he panted. “I—I did it for the best—I
did it for her good——”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried Jeffrey, rising with sudden despair. “For
her good! You saw her—you saw how happy, how innocent
she is! All her life has been happy and free from
care. What would it have been if I had yielded her back
to the man who broke her mother’s heart, the man who
would have hated her for that mother’s sake? Man, man,
don’t torture me with your devilish smile! I did it for
the best!”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill laughed again.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” he murmured, “how dreadfully easy it
is to deceive oneself! Now, here are you, a most excellent
man, I have no doubt, my dear Jeffrey, actually persuading
yourself that in robbing another man of his only
child and depriving her of her rights, you have been
committing a noble and virtuous action! Now I am
sorry to say that I don’t agree with you! I’ve no doubt
you have become attached to the girl——”</p>

<p>Jeffrey put up his hand.</p>

<p>“Silence!” he said, hoarsely. “It is not for such as
you to understand the love I bear her—my child, my
child!”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, the Marquis of Stoyle’s child!” said the
sneering voice.</p>

<p>Jeffrey raised his head and confronted the smiling,
mocking face.</p>

<p>“Enough. You know my secret, and you alone——”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?” said Spenser Churchill,
smoothly. “Are you sure that no one else shares it?”</p>

<p>Jeffrey made a gesture of assent.</p>

<p>“No one else. Not even she. To-day I had resolved
to tell her.”</p>

<p>A flash came into the watchful eyes.</p>

<p>“To-day—ah, yes!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jeffrey, with a deep sigh that was almost
a groan, “I have brought myself to it at last, after much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
a struggle as you cannot understand. To-day she was
to be told, was to take her future into her own hands; to
choose—” his voice broke—“between one who has loved
her like a father, and the man who drove her mother
from his house and broke her heart!”</p>

<p>“Hem—yes!” murmured Spenser Churchill; “and you
flatter yourself she will remain with you, of course?”</p>

<p>“You do not know her,” was the tremulous reply.
“You do not know her! My child, my child!”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill watched him in silence from under
his white, smooth lids.</p>

<p>“By the way, my dear Jeffrey,” he said softly, “did it
ever strike you, that supposing Lady Mary decided to
return to her father”—Jeffrey winced—“her father—that
the marquis might refuse to acknowledge her?”</p>

<p>Jeffrey looked at him as if he scarcely understood.</p>

<p>“You see,” continued Spenser Churchill, resting his
foot on the tree, and leaning forward with a subtle smile;
“it is such an extraordinary story; the marquis might be
inclined to remark that he would require some proofs!
I need scarcely remind you that he is not the most credulous
of men; in fact, that he is rather inclined to be
suspicious.”</p>

<p>Jeffrey nodded grimly.</p>

<p>“I know him,” he said, almost as if to himself. “I
have thought of that, and am prepared with proofs.”
He put his hand to his breast pocket mechanically, and
drew out the papers, and Spenser Churchill’s eyes darted
to them with a swift eagerness. “If—if Doris chooses to—to
go to him, and leave me, it will not be in his power
to repudiate her! These,” and he touched the papers
with his forefinger, and then put them in his pocket
again; “these will establish her birth beyond dispute.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear it. That is quite satisfactory,
quite. And so, my dear Jeffrey, you expect the young
lady to renounce her father, the marquis—her rank and
title, and all that would become hers—think of it—and
remain with you; all will go on as before, and the father
and his adopted child will be happy ever afterward, like
the people in the fairy story?”</p>

<p>Jeffrey nodded, and the deep lines in his face grew
lighter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he said in a low voice again, as if he were communing
with himself rather than answering the other
man’s question; “yes, we shall take up our lives as before,
my child, my Doris and I! She will be my Doris
still, mine to love, and guard, and watch over! You
saw her——” he went on with suppressed eagerness.
“There was truth in what you said, though you meant it
insultingly; she will be a great actress—great! And it is
I who have taught her—I, who loved her mother! You
taunted me, Spenser Churchill, with selfish aims in keeping
from her the knowledge of her birth. It was unjust.
‘Hide my child from him always—always, Jeffrey!’ she
said. They were her last words. Poor Lucy!”</p>

<p>His head drooped, and he covered his eyes with his
thin, gaunt hands for a moment; then, as if remembering
the presence of the other man, turned to him.</p>

<p>“You are here still? Why are you waiting? Go your
way, and let me go mine. You know my secret—it is
no concern of yours. Forget it, as you forget the wrong
you did me. Go!” and he pointed down the path.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill smiled blandly.</p>

<p>“My dear Jeffrey, doesn’t it occur to you that perhaps
this little secret of yours does concern me?”</p>

<p>The haggard eyes were raised to the smooth, mocking
face.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it occur to you that, though you don’t appear
to have any conscience to speak of, that I may not be
so hardened. Oh, fie, Jeffrey! You know, you really
must know, what it is my duty to do!”</p>

<p>“Your duty?” repeated Jeffrey, in a low voice. “What
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear sir, of course it is my duty to go to the
marquis, and inform him of the existence of his child.
Oh! and how sweet a duty,” he murmured, “to restore
a long lost child to its father’s loving arms!”</p>

<p>Jeffrey sprang to his feet, and stood, breathing hard,
his hand clinched tightly at his side.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill looked at him with an air of gentle
reproach.</p>

<p>“I cannot think how it is you haven’t seen that from
the first, dear Jeffrey. You may be so lost to all sense
of right as to conceal the fact of Lady Mary’s existence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
but I—oh, my dear Jeffrey—I am a man of honor and
must act as my conscience dictates. And how great a
reward will be mine! To restore to a father the child
he has mourned as dead! The dear marquis, I can picture
his delight—” the smile grew sardonic for a moment—“his
delight at recovering her, and his gratitude
to you——”</p>

<p>Jeffrey drew nearer.</p>

<p>“You—you will do this?” he panted, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Spenser Churchill; then with a rapid
change of voice, and laying his hand on the quivering
shoulder of the man he was torturing, he added, “unless
you come to my terms, my dear Jeffrey.”</p>

<p>“Your terms?” echoed Jeffrey, his face working, his
hands clasping and unclasping each other.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill nodded blandly.</p>

<p>“Y—es. I take an interest in this charming young
lady; I knew her mother, you see——”</p>

<p>“Beware!” broke from Jeffrey’s parched lips. “Don’t—don’t
try me too hard!”</p>

<p>“And I should like to have a hand in restoring her to
her proper place, or permitting her to remain under your
care.”</p>

<p>“You mean that her fate is to be in your hands?”</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly; and that it may do so most completely
and satisfactorily, I think I will take charge of those interesting
papers which you referred to, my dear Jeffrey.”</p>

<p>Jeffrey’s hand flew to his breast.</p>

<p>“The papers!” he articulated, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t say you will not, my dear fellow, because
if you do you will compel me to go straight to the marquis—who
is at Barton Towers, by the way——”</p>

<p>“Barton Towers—the marquis—Doris!” muttered
Jeffrey wildly and with a vacant stare.</p>

<p>“Yes, Doris, who will not be your Doris any longer,
but will have to remain with her father, the marquis,
whether she likes it or not——”</p>

<p>He had gone too far. With a spring, the tortured man
was upon him, the long, thin fingers fastened tightly in
the soft, white throat, the gaunt face was close upon the
smooth, false one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>Spenser Churchill reeled, and went down on one knee.</p>

<p>“Take your hands off!” he croaked, suffocatingly, as
he struggled to release himself; but Jeffrey, though the
older man of the two, seemed possessed of the strength
of an athlete, and, after a desperate struggle, Spenser
Churchill lay on his back, with Jeffrey’s knee on his
chest, and Jeffrey’s fingers still choking him.</p>

<p>“Are—are you going to murder me?” he managed to
gasp out.</p>

<p>“I am going to kill you!” was the grim reply, a wild,
fierce light burning in the hollow eyes. “One kills a
snake, not murders it. I kill you as I would any other
vermin!”</p>

<p>“Jeffrey—let me go! Let me go, and I swear to keep
your secret. I swear—my honor——”</p>

<p>An awful smile lit up the face above him.</p>

<p>“Trust her happiness to your oath!” he said, hoarsely.
“Trust her to your honor!” the hands tightened, the sky
grew black, the trees danced a mad carnival in Spenser
Churchill’s eyes, and they were closing for the last time,
when suddenly the steel-like fingers relaxed their hold;
Jeffrey reeled back, and, throwing up his arms,
screamed:</p>

<p>“Doris, Doris!” and fell across the man who, only a
moment ago, was at his mercy.</p>

<p>Dazed, sick with terror, and half-suffocated, Spenser
Churchill struggled to his feet and staggered to a tree.
He leaned against it for a moment or two, panting and
gasping, tugging at the collar of his shirt, and regaining
his breath, and at last he looked shudderingly at the still
form upon the ground.</p>

<p>Still shuddering, he went toward and knelt over it.</p>

<p>“Fainted!” he exclaimed, hoarsely. “Another moment!”
a shiver ran over his sleek, white face. “Another
moment and I should have been lying like that.
The madman!”</p>

<p>He spurned the body with his foot.</p>

<p>“Lie there and cool yourself!” he snarled, and was
turning away, when suddenly he started and put his
hand to his brow.</p>

<p>“The beast has driven my senses out of me! The
papers! Of course! Ha, ha, Master Jeffrey!” and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
kneeling down again, he hurriedly turned the still figure
over, and, unbuttoning the waistcoat, snatched out the
papers.</p>

<p>As he did so, something—was it the nameless terror of
death, to which mortal humanity is and ever will be
thrall?—something made him wince and shrink back.</p>

<p>He stared for a moment or two at the white face, then,
slowly, slowly, extended his hand, and trembling, laid it
over the heart. The next instant he started back, and,
white as the face beneath him, cried:</p>

<p>“Great Heaven! He’s dead!”</p>

<p class="center">THE PART OF A HYPOCRITE.</p>


<p>“Doris!” The cry rang through the wood and reached
the spot where Doris lay full length upon the bank like
a crushed flower. For a moment she thought it was an
invention of her disordered mind, then she seemed to
recognize Jeffrey’s voice, and, thrusting the letter in her
bosom, she sprang to her feet, and, with hurried steps,
made her way, half-blindly, in the direction of the sound.</p>

<p>A few moments brought her to the open glade, and,
with a cry of terror, she was on her knees beside the still
form.</p>

<p>She had never before been in the presence of death,
and for a time she thought that he had only fainted, and
she raised his head and called upon him in accents of
alarm and affection; then suddenly she heard a step behind
her, and, looking round, saw the smooth, bland face
of the man who had stood up in the box at the theatre, the
man against whom Jeffrey had warned her.</p>

<p>She shrank back and clasped the dead man closer to
her, as if to protect him.</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?” asked Spenser Churchill,
with tender concern. “Dear me, I am afraid there has
been an accident; the gentleman is ill?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” panted Doris. “Help me! oh, help me!”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill knelt down and examined the stern
face with an anxious regard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I know him!” he said, with an air of surprise.
“It is Mr. Flint—Mr. Jeffrey Flint, is it not?”</p>

<p>Doris made a gesture of assent without removing her
eyes from the old man’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes. Is he—is he very ill?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill shook his head, solemnly.</p>

<p>“I am afraid—how did it happen, Miss Marlowe? It
is Miss Marlowe, is it not?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” sobbed Doris, heedless of the latter
part of the question. “I—I was not here—I heard him
call! Oh, Jeffrey, Jeffrey! dear Jeffrey! Is he——A
doctor! oh, if I could get a doctor! Some one——”</p>

<p>“My dear young lady!” murmured Spenser Churchill,
pityingly, “I am afraid—do not give way, bear up! In
the midst of life——”</p>

<p>A cry rang through the wood, and a shudder shook
her frame, then she looked up with a terrible calmness.</p>

<p>“You say that he is dead—is that it? Dead! Oh,
Heaven, dead!”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill shook his head.</p>

<p>“I fear—I very much fear——” he murmured, gravely,
and he laid his hand upon the thin wrist. “And you do
not know how it happened?” he asked again, his eyes
scrutinizing her face with a quick keenness.</p>

<p>“No!” said Doris, hoarsely, and with a sob. “He was
alone—I was coming to meet him—I heard him call my
name, and—and I found him like this! Oh, what shall
I do? What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Can you bear to be left alone for a little while?” said
Spenser Churchill. “There is a cottage near here, on
the outskirts of the wood. I will go and get some assistance.
The poor fellow has died from a sudden attack
of heart disease!”</p>

<p>“Oh, go, go!” panted Doris.</p>

<p>He went, after another searching glance at her white
face; and she bent over the motionless form, almost as
lifeless herself.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Spenser Churchill returned, with a
couple of farm laborers carrying a hurdle, and the body
was tenderly and reverently carried to the house, Doris
walking beside it and still holding the cold, dead hand.</p>

<p>Hasty preparation had been made for the reception of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
the stricken man, and he was carried up to the best room.
A messenger had been sent to Barton for the doctor,
and in a short time he appeared and was received by Mr.
Spenser Churchill, who awaited him at the gate.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jeffrey Flint!” said the doctor, as Spenser
Churchill, in sympathetic accents, gave an account of the
case. “Yes, yes! Ah, yes, I know something of him; he
consulted me a few days ago.”</p>

<p>Then he passed upstairs and into the room where the
dead man lay upon the bed, with Doris kneeling beside
him still holding his hand.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said the doctor, after a short examination,
“this is no place for you. No one can do anything for
him; your friend has gone to his last rest,” and he motioned
to the woman of the cottage, who stood crying at
the door.</p>

<p>Slowly, reluctantly, Doris permitted them to take her
away, and the doctor after a few minutes went downstairs
and rejoined Spenser Churchill.</p>

<p>“It is only too true, I see,” said that gentleman, sadly.</p>

<p>The doctor nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said; “he has been dead some time. It is
very sad, very! That poor young creature—Miss Marlowe,
I believe?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill nodded again.</p>

<p>“I believe so,” he said.</p>

<p>“Poor girl, poor girl!” murmured the kind-hearted
doctor, turning his face away. “So suddenly.”</p>

<p>“My heart bleeds for her!” said Spenser Churchill,
wiping away something that may have been a tear. “So
young and friendless——”</p>

<p>“Friendless?” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Well, I am given to understand she has no father or
mother,” he explained. “I should not have said friendless.
I trust, I humbly trust, that, seeing I was on the
spot, sent, so to speak, providentially, that she will permit
me to be of some service to her, poor young thing.”</p>

<p>He took out his cardcase and handed a card.</p>

<p>The doctor glanced at it and bowed.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Spenser Churchill? Your name is known
to me, sir, of course; and I feel that I am justified in saying
that this poor girl will indeed have a friend in you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
if you are the Mr. Spenser Churchill, the well-known
philanthropist.”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill cast down his eyes and sighed.</p>

<p>“I have no claim to so high a title, doctor,” he said,
meekly, “though I trust I may say that I take a humble
interest in any good work. Poor girl, poor girl! I fear
there will have to be an inquest? That will be a terrible
trial for her!” and he shot a glance under his lids at the
doctor’s thoughtful face.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, hesitatingly, “I don’t know. I—I
really think it may be avoided.”</p>

<p>“If it is not quite necessary,” said Spenser Churchill,
softly. “It is a trying ordeal for the survivor at any time,
but with this poor child, so young and sensitive——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” assented the doctor. “I do not think it
will be necessary. Mr. Flint consulted me the day before
yesterday, and I warned him then that he must be
careful to avoid all excitement; indeed, I told him as
plainly as I dared that any sudden shock would be fatal.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! Poor fellow!” murmured Spenser
Churchill.</p>

<p>“And I think, under the circumstances, that I can give
a certificate, and so avoid an inquest.”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill heaved a soft sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad if you will tell me all you know respecting
the case, Mr. Churchill?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” assented Spenser Churchill, with a sigh.
“It is soon told. I was strolling through the woods in
the direction of the town—I had left the Towers half-an-hour
previously—when I heard a girl’s voice—poor Miss
Marlowe’s, in fact—crying piteously. I hurried up, and
found her kneeling beside him. That is all, excepting
that I am quite sure he was dead when I reached the
spot, and I think he had been dead some time.”</p>

<p>The doctor smiled.</p>

<p>“And you met no one, saw no one excepting Miss
Marlowe?”</p>

<p>“No, no one; I heard and saw nothing but what I
have told you,” replied Spenser Churchill, quietly.</p>

<p>“Hem! I don’t quite see. It would appear as if
there had been a shock——”</p>

<p>“Is that absolutely necessary?” suggested Spenser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
Churchill, softly. “In heart disease death may result—I
speak with deference—without any shock or excitement.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite so, quite so,” assented the doctor. “The
deceased might have died at any moment—in his bed, or
during his ordinary avocations. Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“I am relieved to hear you say that,” said Spenser
Churchill. “I am so anxious, on Miss Marlowe’s account,
to avoid an inquest.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, quite so. There will be no necessity. Did
you know the deceased?”</p>

<p>“I knew something of him some years ago,” replied
Spenser Churchill; “but we have not met for a long
period; indeed, it must be ten or fifteen years. I only
knew him quite slightly, and had not seen him of late,
even at a distance. It was quite a shock to me, recognizing
him lying there on the grass, dead!”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” said the doctor, quite sympathetically.
“And now, what is to be done?—I mean, with reference
to this poor young girl.”</p>

<p>“If you will leave it to me,” murmured Spenser
Churchill, meekly, “I will do all that lies in my power.
She may have relations and friends. I will ascertain from
her, and communicate with them. You may trust me to
do all that I can to soften the terrible blow for the poor
young creature.”</p>

<p>The doctor took his hand and wrung it.</p>

<p>“You are a good man, Mr. Churchill,” he said, “and
Heaven will reward you! Pray count upon me if I can
be of any assistance. I will go and make out the certificate.”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill accompanied him to his gig, then lit
a cigarette, and paced up and down for a few minutes,
thinking intensely.</p>

<p>His voice and manner, while he had been talking with
the simple-minded provincial doctor, had been completely
under control—quiet, calm, and sadly sympathetic;
but now that he was alone he felt that his hands were
shaking, and that his face was white.</p>

<p>“My dear—Spenser—” he murmured. “Steady—steady!”
and he held his hand out and regarded it clinically.
“No shaking and trembling! Chance—or shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
we say Providence—has placed a great game in your
hands, and you must play it properly if you mean to win,
and you do mean to win! Great Heaven, what a narrow
escape it was! Another minute, another half-minute, and
you would have been removed from this terrestial
sphere! And to think that he should have died just at
the critical moment! It was a special interposition! Let
me think—now, steady, my dear fellow, steady! Jeffrey
dead—thank Heaven!—no one but myself knows the secret
of this girl’s birth! The papers—” he took them
from his pocket, and looked at them, and it may be
stated, to his credit, that a shudder ran through him as
he did so, for they still seemed warm by their contact
with their dead owner, from whom he had stolen them—“yes,
he was right. They are all here; proof incontestable,
evidence that no one, not even the dear marquis,
could refute! No one knows of their existence but
myself! And she is alone and friendless, yes, friendless,
for my letter has done its work, and Cecil Neville is too
far off to undo it! We must keep you in Ireland, dear
Cecil, we cannot have you back interfering in this business.
No one knows that Doris Marlowe is the daughter
of the Marquis of Stoyle, but me. Spenser, my dear
fellow, you hold all the cards, play them carefully and
properly, and——” he flung the stump of his cigarette
into the hedge, and, smoothing his face into its usual
bland expression, returned to the cottage.</p>

<p>The woman, the wife of the woodman, stood waiting
for him.</p>

<p>“How is poor Miss Marlowe, Mrs. Jelf?” he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jelf dropped a curtsey.</p>

<p>“Ah, poor young thing, sir!” she said, wiping her eyes
with her apron. “She’s lying down, sir, quite worn out
and looking like a corpse herself! It don’t seem as if she
had strength to speak or move! I was thinking, sir, that
we’d better send for her friends——”</p>

<p>“Not at present, I think, Mrs. Jelf,” he said, gently.
“I think she had better be left to herself for a while. I
have promised the doctor to do all I can in my poor
way——”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, I know you’ve a kind heart,” murmured Mrs.
Jelf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“We must all do our simple best, Mrs. Jelf,” he replied,
lifting up his eyes. “I happen to know something
of the poor fellow who lies upstairs, and, for the sake of
old times, you understand, and for the sake of the poor
young lady——”</p>

<p>“And she such a sweet young thing!” said Mrs. Jelf,
beginning to cry again.</p>

<p>“I will do my best for her. I am now going to the
town, and I think, Mrs. Jelf, it would be as well, if any
one inquires for Miss Marlowe, if you told them that she
is not well enough to see anybody. And if there should
be any letters, perhaps you will give them to me; I will
keep them until poor Miss Marlowe is strong enough to
see them. At such times as these, in moments of such
deep sorrow as this, Mrs. Jelf, the human heart must
not be harassed by contact with the outer world.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, sir,” assented Mrs. Jelf, quite touched by
such sympathetic consideration. “I won’t let any one
see her, and she shan’t be worried by anything. I’ll keep
people from her, and I’ll give you any letters.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I think it will be better,” said Spenser
Churchill. “Perhaps you might tell Miss Marlowe that
a friend—you need not mention my name; you might say
the doctor—has gone to the theatre and will make all arrangements.
All she has to do is to try and remain quiet.
Rest, rest, my dear Mrs. Jelf, is the great soother for the—er—tortured
breast,” and leaving this sublime piece of
sentiment to do its work in honest Mrs. Jelf’s mind, he
went off to Barton.</p>

<p>Ill news travels apace, and the tidings of Jeffrey’s
sudden death had reached the theatre even before
Spenser Churchill arrived there.</p>

<p>His manner with the manager was simply perfection.</p>

<p>“I came on at once, my dear sir,” he said, “because I
felt that you should be the first to know of this—er—dreadful
calamity. I am fully sensible of the responsible
position you occupy, and that your relations as a manager
with the public entitle you to every consideration.
Of course, Miss Marlowe will not act for some time—if
ever she acts again.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course!” said the manager, rather
blankly. “Poor Jeffrey! An admirable man, sir; admirable!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Might have been a great actor himself, but
contented himself with presenting an ornament to the
stage in his adopted daughter. A great genius Miss
Marlowe, Mr. Churchill! Splendid! magnificent! A
wonderful career before her! Of course, she can’t be expected
to act at present, certainly not; but in time—ahem!—in
time.”</p>

<p>“We shall see,” said Spenser Churchill. “In time, perhaps;
but I cannot say. I am not authorized to speak
for Miss Marlowe; but this I will say, that if she should
resume her professional career, you—you will have the
first claim upon her!” and he shook the manager’s hand
in so emphatic and impressive a manner that the manager
was quite touched.</p>

<p>Two hours afterward all Barton was placarded with
the announcement that, in consequence of sudden domestic
bereavement, Miss Doris Marlowe would not appear
that evening, and that in place of “Romeo and Juliet,”
would be performed the famous drama, “The Corsican
Brothers.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill was as good as his word. If
he had been a near and dear relative of the bereaved girl,
he could not more completely have taken the whole arrangements
into his own hands. He saw to the funeral,
examined the dead man’s papers and effects; even carried
his thoughtful consideration so far as to ask Mrs.
Jelf to order mourning for Miss Marlowe and herself.
In fact he did all that was necessary on such mournful
occasions—all except one thing. By a strange oversight,
Mr. Spenser Churchill omitted to send notice of the
death to the newspapers, so that there was nothing to tell
Lord Cecil Neville, away in Ireland, that the girl he loved
had suddenly been left alone in the world!</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A CHANCE FOR ESCAPE.</p>


<p>Alone in the world! Lying back in a chair by the open
window of the woodman’s cottage—for she could not
bring herself to go back to the lodgings in Barton, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
every inanimate object would remind her of the father-like
friend she had lost—Doris kept repeating the ominous
words to herself. Although a week had passed since the
funeral she had not yet recovered from the terrible blow,
and as she lay back with half-closed eyes and white, wan
face she still looked “like one wandering in other worlds
than this.”</p>

<p>The dead man had been so much to her. Mother,
father, brother—indeed her only friend and companion—that
the sense of helplessness which follows all bereavement
was intensified in her case. She was indeed utterly
alone; drifting on the stream of life like a rudderless vessel,
to be blown hither and thither by the cruel caprice
of every wind. Since the day of Jeffrey’s death she had
seen no one excepting the kind-hearted woman of the cottage,
Mrs. Jelf; and had done nothing but commune in silence
with the great sorrow that had fallen upon her.</p>

<p>In one day, in one hour, she had lost her lover and the
man who had been as a father to her.</p>

<p>She tried to put all thought of Lord Cecil Neville away
from her, and to think of Jeffrey alone; but with an agony
of remorse she found that the loss of her lover seemed
almost as great a grief as the death of poor Jeffrey.</p>

<p>All day long she dwelt upon the joy and happiness of
those few short days while he had been hers; recalling
every word he had spoken, every tone of the musical voice
that seemed to have spoken of nothing but love—deep,
true, passionate love to her. She remembered how many
times he had kissed her, the fond endearing names by
which he had called her; and now it was all over! So
completely a thing of the past, and gone from her life,
that it appeared more like a dream than a reality. Were
it not for the aching void in her heart, and the letter—the
cruel letter he had written, and that lay crushed and hidden
against her bosom—she could almost have believed
that no such person as Cecil Neville existed.</p>

<p>Where was he now? she wondered. Did he still think
of her? or had he never really loved her?</p>

<p>“Who am I, that I should have won the love of such as
he?” she asked herself over and over again. “No, he
never loved me! He never loved me, while I——”
Then she would cover her face with her hands, and wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
that she could find relief in the unshed tears that seemed
to scorch her heart.</p>

<p>This morning, as she sat by the window, her hands
folded listlessly in her lap, thinking and thinking till her
head ached, and wishing that she lay in the quiet churchyard
beside Jeffrey, Mrs. Jelf came into the room, and,
speaking in the subdued voice which is perhaps the most
irritating and trying to one in Doris’ condition, said:</p>

<p>“How do you find yourself this morning, miss?”</p>

<p>“I am quite well,” said Doris, rousing herself.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it, miss,” responded Mrs. Jelf, gently
arranging the pillow which she had insisted upon placing
in the armchair. “Do you think you are well enough to
see any one this morning?”</p>

<p>“To see any one?” said Doris, with a start, and a sudden
thrill of the heart, for a wild, mad hope arose within
her breast that it might be Cecil Neville.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss; you are not to unless you quite like, he
says, but if you do feel strong enough——”</p>

<p>“He—who?” asked Doris.</p>

<p>“Mr. Spenser Churchill, the gentleman who has been
so kind all through your great trouble, miss.”</p>

<p>The color ebbed from Doris’ face, and she sank back.</p>

<p>“Mr. Spenser Churchill,” she said, vacantly, then a
vague sense of dread fell upon her, and she recalled Jeffrey’s
warning.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss; the kindest-hearted gentleman as ever I
knew. I’m sure, if he’d been your own father or brother,
he couldn’t have done more. Why, he’s seen to everything,
you know.”</p>

<p>Doris thrilled with an indefinable alarm and remorse.</p>

<p>“Why—why did you not tell me? Why should he
do all this?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Well, miss, because it’s his nature, I suppose,” replied
Mrs. Jelf. “You see, he’s what they call a—a
philanthropish; always ready to do a kind action, and—lor’,
come to that, who wouldn’t be glad to do anything
for a sweet young creature like yourself, left so friendless
and helpless? There he is now, just coming up the
path. Now, you’re not to see him unless you feel strong
enough; he can wait, he says——”</p>

<p>“Will you please tell Mr. Churchill that I will see him,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
said Doris, and Mrs. Jelf, after another pat or two to the
pillow, went out.</p>

<p>Doris tried to brace herself to the coming interview.
Her mind had been so clouded that she had not until this
moment realized all that this strange gentleman—against
whom poor Jeffrey had warned her as her greatest foe—had
done for her, and she scarcely knew how to receive
him.</p>

<p>The door opened and Spenser Churchill entered. He
was dressed in black, and his face was almost seraphic
with its expression of reverent sympathy.</p>

<p>“Do not rise, my dear young lady,” he murmured
softly. “Mrs. Jelf assured me that you felt equal to seeing
me; indeed, wished me to do so, or I should not have
intruded upon the sacred solitude of your grief.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the honeyed accents, the words
seemed to sound artificial to Doris’ acute sense, and she
turned her large dark eyes upon him with an unconscious
scrutiny.</p>

<p>“I am quite well, and I did wish to see you, sir,” she
said, “I wish to thank you for all you have done for me.
I scarcely know yet the extent of your kindness”—her
voice faltered—“I think I must have been ill, for I seem
to have forgotten”—she put her hand to her brow for a
moment, then with an effort recovered herself.</p>

<p>“What I have done, my dear Miss Marlowe, does not
deserve a word of thanks. It has been a sad satisfaction
to me to have been of some slight service to you.”</p>

<p>“But you have done everything,” persisted Doris, in a
low voice—“everything! Why——?” she stopped abruptly,
the question sounded a cold and ungrateful one.</p>

<p>But Mr. Spenser Churchill filled up the pause.</p>

<p>“You would—and not unnaturally—ask why I have
taken upon myself to interfere in your affairs, my dear
young lady?”</p>

<p>Doris made a slight gesture of dissent.</p>

<p>“Well, we will not say interfere,” he murmured, softly;
“we will use the word ‘interested.’ The question is very
easily answered. For one thing, I happened to be on
the spot when your poor guardian—but we will not recall
the sad scene,” he broke off, as Doris winced and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
face grew paler. “And the second reason is that I was
once a friend of poor Mr. Jeffrey’s.”</p>

<p>“A friend?” Doris could not help saying.</p>

<p>He shot a sharp glance at her, unseen by her, and
sighed.</p>

<p>“I understand your surprise,” he said, mournfully.
“You will observe that I said that I was once a friend.
Some time ago, I regret to say, a difference arose between
us. I do not know whether you know the circumstances,
whether he ever told you?”</p>

<p>Doris shook her head, and he emitted a suppressed and
inaudible sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Well, well, we will not speak of it; but this I will
say, the quarrel, the misunderstanding, arose from no
fault of his. The fault was mine, entirely mine, my dear
young lady!”</p>

<p>It was a cunning speech, and produced the effect he had
intended.</p>

<p>“Looking back to that time—when we parted, friends
no longer—my heart is filled with remorse and sorrow!
Ah, Miss Marlowe, if we would all of us reflect that life
is short, and that death may come to prevent forever any
reconciliation between parted friends, how often—ah,
how often the rash and foolish quarrel would be averted;”
and, apparently overcome by his emotion, he turned his
head away and softly blew his nose. “But we will not go
back over this sad quarrel,” he said. “I have come to
see you this morning that I may see if I can be of any
further use to you. I trust I may be. There are several
things I find that I must speak to you about, much as I
should wish to leave you undisturbed.”</p>

<p>“Will you please tell me everything I should know,”
said Doris. “I am ashamed that I should have left everything
so entirely.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” he murmured. “Such a terrible bereavement
as yours, so sudden, is so overwhelming that no excuse
is needed.” He took some papers from his pocket.
“I will not trouble you more than I can avoid with business
matters, my dear young lady, but there are a few
things that I find I must speak to you about. First, I
must ask you if there is any one, any friend you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
rather I went to who would take this trouble off your
shoulders?”</p>

<p>Doris shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, there is no one,” she said, quietly enough and
with a firm voice. “I have no friend in all the world.”</p>

<p>“Except—dare I say except my humble self?” he murmured.
“My dear young lady, what little I have done
afforded me a melancholy satisfaction. I have felt all
through that by serving you in some slight measure, I
have been making an attempt at some poor atonement
for the error that separated my poor dead friend and myself.
Will you allow me to call myself your friend?”</p>

<p>Doris turned to thank him, and he inclined his head
gratefully.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I have taken upon myself to see to all the
arrangements, and have ventured to act, just as if I were,
say your father. It was necessary that I should look into
poor Jeffrey’s affairs, and I have come to tell you the result.
I am sorry to say, my dear young lady, that your
guardian did not leave any wealth behind him. He died
a poor man—perhaps this will not surprise you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Doris, in a low voice; “we were always
poor, I think. There was always enough——”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I understand. There is some money; it is
not much, about a hundred pounds, I think.”</p>

<p>Doris listened with faint interest. If she had heard
that she had been left without a penny, or heiress to a
million, it would not have affected her in her present
condition.</p>

<p>“Besides the money there were some papers—nothing
of any consequence, however—letters and documents relating
to business affairs, engagements at theatres, and
so on.”</p>

<p>A faint flush came into Doris’ face, then left it absolutely
colorless.</p>

<p>“Nothing more?” she said, with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>“Nothing more,” he said, gravely, watching her closely,
though he seemed occupied in turning over the papers.
“Did you expect——”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” she faltered; then she raised her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
large, sad eyes. “You know that I am not—Jeffrey’s
daughter?”</p>

<p>He inclined his head.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that; and I know what you expected—hoped,
shall I say; that I should find something, some
papers that would give us a clew to your parentage. Is
that not so?”</p>

<p>Doris’ lips formed the “Yes.”</p>

<p>He sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I regret there is no such clew. The secret of your
birth, my dear young lady, is buried in my poor friend’s
grave.”</p>

<p>Doris had leaned forward with a suppressed eagerness,
and she sank back as her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, sorry,” he murmured, “for I too had
hoped that I might make some discovery. But there is
not a single paper, not the slightest clew.”</p>

<p>“And yet”—said Doris, more to herself than to him—“there
was something he—he was going to tell me, some
papers; he had them with him the morning——” Her
voice broke.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill listened with the deepest sympathy
glowing in his benevolent face.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” he murmured. “And he did not tell
you? And these papers now? He had them with him,
you say? They were not found. I myself did not examine——;
but the doctor assured me there was nothing
beyond a little money and so on. I fear—I very much
fear—that our poor friend must have decided to allow the
mystery to remain, and have destroyed the papers you
speak of.”</p>

<p>Doris’ hands closed tightly.</p>

<p>“He knew best,” she said, with all a woman’s loving
loyalty. “I—I am satisfied. He knew best,” and the
tears came at last and rolled down the pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>“Nobly said, my dear young lady! Yes, doubtless he
knew best. Rest assured that he kept the secret from you
for good reasons. Yes, he knew best! Poor Jeffrey,
poor Jeffrey!” He wiped his eyes. “And now shall I
go—some other time——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“No, no,” said Doris. “Tell me everything, please; I
do not know what to do—I am so alone——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he said. “About your future; forgive me
if I mention such a subject; but I presume you will continue
your profession——”</p>

<p>A shudder ran through Doris’ frame at the thought of
again facing the crowded theatre.</p>

<p>“No, no!” she said, almost fiercely. “I shall never act
again!”</p>

<p>As she answered, the scene of the first night of “Romeo
and Juliet” rose before her, and she thrilled with the recollection
of the inspiration which had come to her from her
love for Cecil Neville. That inspiration had vanished forever
now, and to act with a broken heart would, she
knew, be impossible to her.</p>

<p>“I shall never go on the stage again,” she responded
firmly.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill put up his white hand to his lips to
hide the smile of satisfaction her words called up on
them.</p>

<p>“No?” he said, thoughtfully and significantly. “Yes, I
understand! I quite understand, and I must say I think
your decision is a wise one. It was different while your
guardian was alive, to watch over you and protect you!
You, great as your success has been, I think you are right
in your resolve to leave the profession.”</p>

<p>“I shall never go back,” she said, quietly.</p>

<p>“Then, forgive me, may I ask what you intend doing?”</p>

<p>Doris let her eyes fall upon him almost vacantly for a
moment. She had been lost in the memory of those few
happy days and nights, and had almost forgotten his
presence.</p>

<p>“What I intend doing? Oh, I don’t know! I have
not thought,” she said, and her white hand went to her
brow.</p>

<p>“I understand! I understand! and fully sympathize,
my dear young lady, but, as your friend—you know you
have allowed me to be your friend—it is my duty to ask
you! This sum of money, alas, will soon take to itself
wings, and——”</p>

<p>Doris roused herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“And I must still live, and eat, even after it is gone,
you would say,” she said, not bitterly, but, ah, so wearily.
“Yes, I know!”</p>

<p>“You could earn a large sum on the stage, of course,”
he murmured.</p>

<p>She put out her hand as if to silence him.</p>

<p>“That is out of the question,” she said. “I suppose
there are other ways of earning money?”</p>

<p>“There are,” he murmured, softly.</p>

<p>“I am young and strong,” she said. “Other women
have to work. What do they do? Needlework——”</p>

<p>She looked at her hands with a smile that was like the
glint of her old light-hearted one.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“That, too, is out of the question,” he said. “But
there are still other ways. I believe—indeed, I have
heard—that you are very accomplished, Miss Marlowe.”</p>

<p>“Am I?” said Doris, simply.</p>

<p>“I believe that you are a musician, and that you speak
several languages——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, as simply as before. “Ah, how much
I owe to him! I understand it better now—now that it
is too late to thank him,” and she turned her head away.</p>

<p>“A good musician and linguist need not take to her
needle for her maintenance,” said Spenser Churchill. “I
have, of course, foreseen that the question would arise,
and I have—pray forgive me, my dear young lady—been
making some inquiries on your behalf.” He drew out a
pocketbook, and took a letter from it. “It happens that
a friend of mine—Lady Despard—you may have heard of
her; she is well known for her charitable work——”</p>

<p>Doris shook her head.</p>

<p>“I have never heard of her,” she said, trying to speak
with some interest.</p>

<p>“A sweet creature! A widow, alas, though young!
Very wealthy, moving in the best society—ahem!—and
fond of traveling. She is just going abroad, and requires
a companion. I think—I am sure—that you
would like her, and that if you could bring yourself to
accept the position, which is so much below your
genius——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“She is going abroad?” said Doris, with sudden eagerness.</p>

<p>He inclined his head.</p>

<p>“Yes, to Italy. The change would do you good—is,
indeed, absolutely necessary.”</p>

<p>Abroad, out of England, beyond the chance of meeting
Cecil Neville! A faint hope, for the first time since
Jeffrey’s death, rose in Doris’ heart.</p>

<p>“But you need not decide to-day. You shall think it
over,” he said, taking up his hat. “By the way, if you
should need me, will you send word—at any time, and the
very moment you would like to see me—to Barton Towers?
I am staying with my friend, the Marquis of
Stoyle.”</p>

<p>Doris started, and the blood rose to her face.</p>

<p>“Barton Towers?” she murmured, mechanically.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, smoothly, as if he had not noticed her
sudden agitation. “The marquis is an old friend of mine.
So is his nephew and heir, Lord Cecil Neville. You may
have heard of him?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I—have heard of him,” said Doris, in a low
voice, which faltered, notwithstanding her efforts to keep
it steady.</p>

<p>“Yes; a most charming young fellow,” he went on, with
a smile, “but a terribly unsteady one. But, there, we
must not be hard upon a young fellow in his position.
Young men who are blessed with good looks and heirships
to marquisates are apt to be unsteady; though I
am glad to say that Lord Neville’s wild days are nearly
over. He is in Ireland at present, but when he comes
back he is to marry Lady Grace Peyton.”</p>

<p>Doris sat perfectly motionless, her hands clasped in
her lap, her eyes fixed on the lovely summer scene framed
in the window; but the view was all blurred in her sight,
and a sound as of rushing waves rang in her ears.</p>

<p>“To marry Lady Grace Peyton!” she echoed, dully, as
if the words possessed no sense.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he purred. “It is a very old attachment. She
is a most charming and beautiful creature, and I am not
surprised that, notwithstanding his numerous flirtations,
Lord Neville has remained constant. It will be a most
suitable and advantageous match for both of them——My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
dear young lady,” he broke off, for Doris had sunk
back, white to the lips, and with closed eyes, “you are ill.
Let me call Mrs. Jelf.”</p>

<p>But, with an almost superhuman effort, Doris fought
down the terrible faintness, and, stretching out her hand,
commandingly, said:</p>

<p>“No! It is nothing. The heat—stay, please!”</p>

<p>He stood, regarding her silently, watchfully, with an
anxious, sympathetic expression on his smooth face.</p>

<p>“This lady”—she went on, speaking every word as if
it cost her an effort—“this Lady Despard. Will you ask
her to take me?”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Miss Marlowe! Had you not better
consider——”</p>

<p>“I have considered,” she said, interrupting him. “If
she thinks I can be of any service to her—if she is going
away from England at once——”</p>

<p>“She is,” he said, softly.</p>

<p>“Well, then—tell her, please, that I am ready; that I
will go with her!”</p>

<p>“I will do everything you wish, my dear young lady,”
he murmured. “I fear I have wearied you! Leave it all
to me,” and with a softly murmured “Heaven bless you!”
he left her.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">FASHIONING THE WEB.</p>


<p>Two days later, Mrs. Jelf brought Doris a letter. The
envelope bore an elaborate crest, stamped in crimson and
gold, and as she opened it, a faint perfume emanated
from it.</p>

<p>It was from Lady Despard, who wrote—in the delightfully-illegible
hand, all points and angles, known as “the
Italian”—that her dear friend, the well-known philanthropist,
Mr. Spenser Churchill, had recommended Miss
Marlowe to Lady Despard, and, placing the greatest reliance
upon Mr. Churchill, her ladyship would be very
pleased if Miss Marlowe would come to her at number
twelve Chester Gardens, as soon as Miss Marlowe could
find it convenient. Lady Despard added that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
certain, from all Mr. Churchill had said, she and Miss
Marlowe would get on together, and that she intended
starting for Italy as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Doris read and re-read the elegant epistle, vainly striving,
as we all do, to form some idea of the character of
the unknown writer; then she sat down and wrote an
answer, saying that she would come to Chester Gardens
the following day.</p>

<p>Now that she had recovered from the lethargy which
had closely followed her great trouble, she was filled
with a restless desire to get away from Barton and its
painful association. She at once set to work at the preparations
for her journey, and it was not until she had
packed up her things that it occurred to her that she could
not go until she had bidden farewell to Mr. Spenser
Churchill.</p>

<p>Doris’ feeling toward that gentleman was a peculiar
one. He had befriended her when she had been most in
need of a friend; had shown an amount of consideration
and delicacy to her, a stranger, which, when she pondered
over it, amazed her; and she was grateful. But she had
not forgotten the dead man’s warning, and it still haunted
her, although Spenser Churchill had so cleverly managed
to allay her suspicions by his frank confession that, in
the quarrel between him and Jeffrey, he had been in the
wrong. And yet, though her suspicions were allayed, she
was conscious of a strange feeling of disquietude while
in his presence; a feeling that was neither quite dread
nor doubt, but partook of both sentiments.</p>

<p>Still, he had been most kind, and her gratitude would
not allow her to go without seeing him again.</p>

<p>After a good deal of reflection, she wrote a couple of
lines to him, telling him that she had arranged to start
on the morrow, and asking him to call and see her; and
she sent it by a lad to the Towers.</p>

<p>An hour or two later Mr. Spenser Churchill arrived.</p>

<p>“I am glad, very glad, my dear young lady,” he said,
pressing the hand which she gave him, “that you have
resolved to seek change of scene so promptly. You will
find dear Lady Despard a most charming and amiable
lady, who will prove a—er—valuable friend; and I hope,
I may say I am sure, that you will be happy. You must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
let me have the pleasure of seeing you off by the train to-morrow——”</p>

<p>Doris shook her head gently but firmly.</p>

<p>“I could not let you take so much trouble,” she said.
“I am leaving quite early in the morning, and——”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, well, I understand. That shall be as you wish.
And is there anything I can do now? Your luggage——”</p>

<p>“It is all ready,” said Doris. “I am quite prepared.”</p>

<p>“Then nothing remains for me to do but to hand over
to you the money I hold for you,” he said, and he took
out and counted some banknotes.</p>

<p>Doris colored.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” she said, “that I would ask
you to be so good as to take charge of some of it for me.
It seems so large a sum—I have never been used to having
large sums of money,” her eyes filled as she spoke.
“I am ashamed to cause you any further trouble, but if
you will take charge of some of it for me, if you will
give me twenty pounds, and keep the rest in case I should
want it, I shall be very grateful: you will be adding to all
your past kindness to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I see. I shall be very happy,” he said, benevolently.
“Twenty pounds; that will leave eighty. And
when you want it you can write to me. Perhaps when
you come to know Lady Despard you will like her to act
as your banker. By the way, I don’t think we said anything
about the remuneration?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Doris; “I did not think of it.”</p>

<p>“You left it all to me. Quite right. Well, I hope you
will think I have done the best I could. Lady Despard
and I have agreed upon a hundred pounds a year.”</p>

<p>“That is a great deal, I suppose,” said Doris, simply.
“It is more than enough, and once more I thank you.”</p>

<p>“It is not more than enough, not half enough in return
for so sweet and charming a companion, but, my dear
young lady, we must be content,” he said. “And now, is
there anything else?”</p>

<p>Doris replied in the negative, then suddenly her face
crimsoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“There is one thing more,” she said in a low voice.
“Can you tell me Lord Neville’s address in Ireland?”</p>

<p>Her voice faltered, but her clear pure eyes met his
steadily. He showed not the faintest surprise, but seemed
to think for a moment or two.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say I cannot,” he said. “Did you want
to write to him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “I wish I could tell you——” her
voice broke.</p>

<p>He raised his hand with a soft, deprecating smile.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady, tell me nothing more than you
wish. I am—” he laid his hand upon his heart—“I beg
you to believe that I am not curious. Why should you
not write to Lord Neville, if you choose, or to any other
person? I presume you know him?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I know him,” she said, turning her head aside.</p>

<p>“Just so,” he assented, smoothly. “And you wish to
tell him where you are going? Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“No!” said Doris, suddenly, and turning pale. “I do
not wish him to know—ah, I cannot tell you, you would
not understand!”</p>

<p>“You shall tell me nothing,” he said, waving his hand.
“I am sorry I can’t give you his address. But I will tell
you what we can do!” he added as if an idea had occurred
to him. “If you will write to him and intrust the letter
to me, I will see that it is forwarded—indeed, I will get
the address from the marquis and forward it to-night.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Doris, in a low voice, and she went
to the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill, with true delicacy, slipped out,
and had a few minutes’ chat with Mrs. Jelf, who was reduced
to tears at the prospect of losing her young charge.</p>

<p>When he came back, Doris was standing with a note in
her hand.</p>

<p>“There it is,” she said. “If”—she paused for a second,
then went on firmly—“if Lord Neville should ask you
where I am gone, will you promise not to tell him, please?
No one knows but yourself, and—and I do not wish him
to be told.”</p>

<p>He inclined his head as he took the note, and with a
great show of carefulness, put it in his pocketbook.</p>

<p>“My lips are sealed, my dear young lady. Whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
your reasons may be—and please understand that I do
not seek to know them—your request shall be considered
sacred by me. Lord Neville shall never learn your whereabouts
from me!” and it is only fair to say, that for once,
Mr. Spenser Churchill spoke the truth!</p>

<p>A subdued and placid smile beamed on his benevolent
countenance when, having taken leave of Doris, he made
his way across the meadows to the Towers; and the smile
grew more placid and self-complacent when, having
reached his own rooms, he took the note from his pocket,
and rang for a jug of hot water.</p>

<p>“Let it be quite hot, if you please,” he said to the
chamber-maid, and the girl brought it almost boiling.</p>

<p>Then he locked the door, and, holding the envelope over
the steam until it had become ungummed, he drew out
the note, and read it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was right, and you were wrong. It would have been better
if we had never met, and I hope that we may never meet again.
If we should do so, it must be as strangers. No one shall ever
learn from me that we have ever been anything else.</p>

<p class="signature">
“<span class="smcap">Doris Marlowe.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>He pondered over these few lines, word by word, for
some minutes, then, with a satisfied nod, re-enclosed the
note in its envelope, and neatly re-fastened it.</p>

<p>“I don’t think any one, however sharp and critical his
sight, would detect that her little note had been opened,”
he murmured. “The gum had scarcely dried. Yes, that
will do very well! Admirably; in fact, there is no need
for me to add a word. But all the same, my dear young
lady, we will not send it to Cecil Neville just yet! No,
no, it would be so sudden a shock. No, really, in common
charity, we must give him some slight preparation.”</p>

<p>Then he took from his pocket four letters, and, with
a soft smile of enjoyment, read them over.</p>

<p>They were in Lord Cecil’s anything but elegant handwriting,
and were addressed to Miss Marlowe at the
lodgings, and had kindly been taken charge of by Mr.
Spenser Churchill.</p>

<p>“Youth, rash youth! How frantically he writes!
Dear me, I am very glad Providence permitted me to
keep them from the dear young thing’s sight; they would
have unsettled her so sadly! Quite eloquent they are!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
I had no idea Master Cecil had such a ready pen. I am
afraid you are spending anything but a pleasant time
over there waiting for the answers to these frantic epistles,
the answer which will rather surprise you when you
get it. What will you do when you find the bird has
flown, I wonder? Be as mad as a March hare for a few
days, and then——” He shrugged his shoulders, and
with a laugh, struck a match and made a bonfire of the
intercepted letters, and watched them until all that remained
of their imploring eloquence was a little heap of
ashes in the empty grate.</p>

<p>In such excellent spirits was Mr. Spenser Churchill, so
full of the peace which flows from the possession of a
good conscience, that, as he entered the drawing-room a
few minutes before dinner that evening, he hummed a
few bars from the “Lost Chord,” that cheerful melody
being the nearest approach to profane music which he
permitted himself; and, going up to the sofa upon which
Lady Grace was reclining, raised her white hand to his
lips and kissed it with playfully solemn gallantry.</p>

<p>She snatched her hand away impatiently, and drawing
her handkerchief over the spot his lips had touched,
said:</p>

<p>“You appear conspicuously cheerful to-night. May
one inquire the reason? Don’t trouble to tell me if you
are not sure it will be interesting. I am quite bored
enough already,” and she moved her fan with a weary
gesture.</p>

<p>“Bored, dear lady!” he murmured, smoothing his long,
yellow hair from his forehead. “Now, really! And I
am never bored! But then I am always busy; I never
permit my mind to be unoccupied. Surely one can always
find some pleasant and congenial task to lighten
the lengthy hours——”</p>

<p>She flashed a scornful look at him from her keen eyes.</p>

<p>“Please don’t treat me as if I were the audience at a
charity meeting.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” he murmured softly. “Charity-meeting ladies
do not wear such charming toilettes as this; would that
they did!” and he beamed down admiringly at the magnificent
evening dress. “What a pity it is that it should
be wasted—no, I will not say that!—but it is a pity there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
are not younger eyes to see and admire it than mine
and the dear marquis’. Now, if Cecil were here—he has
so keen an appreciation for all that is beautiful!”</p>

<p>She looked up at him sharply.</p>

<p>“What do you want to tell me about him?” she demanded
quickly, a faint color coming into her face. “Is—is
he coming back?”</p>

<p>“Is Cecil coming back, dear marquis?” he asked, turning
as the door opened and the marquis entered.</p>

<p>The marquis stopped and looked from one to the other
under his brows.</p>

<p>“You should know best. The person who sent him
to Ireland probably knows when he can come back,” he
said, with cold contempt.</p>

<p>“Now, now, really I must protest!” said Spenser
Churchill, wagging his forefinger playfully. “I know
nothing about it, nothing whatever. It was on your business
he went, dear lord, not mine. No, come now,
really!”</p>

<p>The marquis smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “She”—and he indicated
Lady Grace with a slight motion of his hand—“knows,
or guesses, all about it. We neither of us have any desire
to rob you of the credit of the plot, eh, Grace?”</p>

<p>She shrugged her snowy shoulders with an air of indifference,
but she could not keep her eagerness from
flashing in her eyes, which were fixed on Spenser
Churchill’s smooth, smiling face.</p>

<p>“Well, if you ask my advice, I should say dear Cecil
might as well come back; not quite directly, but say—yes—say,
in a week.”</p>

<p>The marquis raised his eyebrows with haughty indifference.</p>

<p>“When you like! There is a letter from him to-night.”
and he flung it on the table. “He seems to have unmasked
the agent, and made himself quite popular with
his dear friends, the great unwashed! I suppose”—with
a sneer—“he will want to go into Parliament next, on the
Radical side, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“Y—es,” murmured Spenser Churchill, as he read the
letter; “I always said dear Cecil was clever.”</p>

<p>“Really?” said the marquis, in a tone of calm and indifferent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
surprise. “The problem with me has always
been whether he was a greater fool than he looked, or
looked a greater fool than he is.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill chuckled oilily, but Lady Grace
half rose, and shut her fan with a snap.</p>

<p>“He who buys Cecil for a fool will lose his money,”
she said.</p>

<p>The marquis made her an elaborate bow, and Spenser
Churchill clapped his fat hands softly.</p>

<p>“Good—very good, dear lady! I must remember that;
I must, indeed! So truly witty.”</p>

<p>“So truly vulgar, you mean,” she said; “but I was following
the marquis’ suit.”</p>

<p>The marquis made her another bow.</p>

<p>“This is quite refreshing,” he said, his thin upper lip
curling scornfully. “And now that we have exchanged
civilities, perhaps Churchill will tell us what is to happen.
Is Cecil to come back and marry this pure and innocent
ballet girl?”</p>

<p>“Actress, actress, dear marquis,” cooed Spenser
Churchill, folding his hands, and smiling with his head
on one side. “If you appeal to me, I am afraid I must
be the bearer of bad news.”</p>

<p>“Bad news! He is married already?” exclaimed Lady
Grace, rising and confronting him with white face and
furious eyes.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill chuckled at her alarm, then, with
his head a little more on one side, murmured:</p>

<p>“No, no! I am sorry to say there is a little hitch—ahem—the
fact is the engagement is broken off.”</p>

<p>“Broken off?” exclaimed Lady Grace, and her face
crimsoned as she leaned forward, with scarcely repressed
eagerness.</p>

<p>The marquis toyed with the diamond stud at his wrist,
and maintained his accustomed air of cold and haughty
indifference; but Spenser Churchill’s keen eyes detected
a slight tremor of the thin, white fingers.</p>

<p>“Y—es! It is very sad, and my heart bleeds for poor
Cecil——” Lady Grace tapped her hand with her fan
with impatience, and seeing and recognizing it, he went
on with still more exasperating slowness. “Only they
who have suffered as he will and must suffer can sympathize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
with him. To have one’s tenderest affections
nipped in the bud, to find that one’s true and devoted
love has been misplaced, and—er—betrayed; ah, how
cruel and sharp a torture it is! Poor Cecil, poor Cecil!”</p>

<p>The fan snapped loudly, its delicate ivory leaves
broken in the restless, impatient fingers.</p>

<p>“Can you not tell us what has occurred—the truth,
without this—this sermon?” she exclaimed, almost
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Yes, pray spare us, if you can, Spenser,” said the
marquis, with a cold smile. “I gather from what you
say, that this miserable business has come to an end. Is
that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Is that so?” demanded Lady Grace.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill heaved a deep sigh, but a faint smile
of satisfaction lurked in his half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>“I regret to say that it is,” he said. “Poor Cecil’s
affections have been wasted! The tenderest emotions
of his heart betrayed! The young lady has—discarded
him!”</p>

<p>The marquis raised his eyebrows and shrugged his
shoulders, but Lady Grace rose and laid her hand—with
no gentle grasp—on Spenser Churchill’s arm.</p>

<p>“Is this true?” she asked, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said; “I have his dismissal in my hand,”
and he held up Doris’ note.</p>

<p>Lady Grace drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“You—you are very clever!” she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her with an affectation of surprise.</p>

<p>“I—I!” he murmured; “I know nothing about it! I
happen to know the young lady slightly, and she, not
knowing Lord Cecil’s address——”</p>

<p>“He must have written to her!” broke in Lady Grace.</p>

<p>“Has he, do you think?” responded Spenser Churchill,
opening his eyes with a childlike innocence.</p>

<p>Lady Grace smiled.</p>

<p>“I see! I see! You intercepted the letters?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon! What did you say? Not knowing
Lord Cecil’s address, Miss Marlowe committed this letter
to my care. Now the question is, shall we send it
on to him, or wait till he comes back? I think you said
he would be back in a week, dear marquis?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“You said so,” said the marquis, coldly.</p>

<p>“Well, in that case, don’t you think it would be better
to wait until he comes back? Letters do miscarry so,
don’t they?”</p>

<p>The marquis smiled sardonically.</p>

<p>“I agree with Lady Grace,” he said. “You are a
clever fellow, Spenser.”</p>

<p>“They do miscarry so often,” continued Spenser
Churchill. “So I think, if you ask me, it will be better to
keep it till he returns. That is my humble advice.”</p>

<p>The marquis nodded.</p>

<p>“And my humble advice is that you are not here when
it is delivered,” he said, with a grim smile. “I have no
doubt you have taken every precaution, but if Cecil
should get an inkling——” He stopped, and smiled again
significantly.</p>

<p>“Dear Cecil,” murmured Spenser Churchill; “I should
so like to have stayed till he came back, and attempted
to soothe and comfort him”—the marquis smiled more
sardonically than before—“but,” continued Spenser
Churchill, “I am sorry to say important business compels
me to return to London to-morrow, so I must
leave the letter in your charge. You will take every
care of it? Poor Cecil! And you must be very kind
and gentle with him, dear Lady Grace!”</p>

<p>“We will take every care of it, and Lady Grace will
be very kind and gentle, no doubt,” retorted the marquis,
with a sneer.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">IN STRANGE SURROUNDINGS.</p>


<p>Feeling as if the world were quite a new and different
one, and she equally new and strange, Doris left Barton
the following morning, Mrs. Jelf driving her to the
station in a little pony-cart, and obviously weeping as
the train left the station.</p>

<p>It was not a particularly long journey, and the time
passed very quickly, as it seemed to Doris, for she was
thinking all the time, dwelling on the past and considering
what the future would be like, and when they reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
Waterloo she was about to ask a porter for a cab, when
a footman came up to the carriage, and, touching his hat,
inquired if she were Miss Marlowe.</p>

<p>“The carriage is quite close, miss,” he said, with evident
respect, after a glance at the slim, graceful, black-clad
figure and delicately refined face. “She’s a lady,
anyhow,” was his mental comment.</p>

<p>The carriage was an admirably appointed one, the
horses evidently as good as money could buy, and the
get-up of the equipage quiet and reserved, corresponding
with the dark liveries of the coachman and footman.</p>

<p>They went, at a smart, businesslike pace, through the
crowded Strand, and, entering the sacred regions of the
upper ten, pulled up at one of the largest houses in
Chester Gardens.</p>

<p>Now, there is one advantage, at any rate, in being an
actress: that nothing surprises you. No grandeur can
overwhelm a person who has been nightly playing with
kings and queens—perhaps enacted a queen herself; and
though the first glimpse of the interior of Lady Despard’s
town house was rather startling, Doris was capable of concealing
her surprise. The house was new, and magnificently
furnished after the latest art craze. The hall was
intended to represent the outer court of a Turkish harem,
with richly chased arches, marble passages, tropical ferns,
and a plashing fountain. Brilliantly colored rugs made
splashes of color on the cool marble, and here and there
a huge but graceful vase lent variety to the decorations.
It certainly rather reminded you of one of the divisions
of a Turkish bath; but Lady Despard couldn’t help that.</p>

<p>As Doris passed through this oriental hall she heard
the sound of an organ, and found that one stood in a
dimly-lighted recess. A young man was playing, and he
scarcely raised his eyes from the keys as he glanced at her.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe,” said the footman, opening a door
on the left of the hall, and Doris entered a room as dimly
lighted as the organ recess; so dark, in fact, that for a
moment she could distinguish nothing; the next, however,
she saw a lady rise from a low divan and approach her.</p>

<p>Doris could not make out her features, but she heard
a very pleasant and musical voice say:</p>

<p>“How do you do, Miss Marlowe? I am so glad you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
have come. Will you sit down a little while, or would
you rather go to your own room first?”</p>

<p>Doris sat down, and Lady Despard drawing aside a
curtain from before a stained-glass window, Doris saw
that her ladyship was young and remarkably pretty; she
was dressed in exquisite taste, and in colors which set
off her delicate complexion and softly-languid eyes.
Lady Despard scanned Doris’ face for a second or two,
and her gaze grew more interested.</p>

<p>“It was very good of you to come to me, Miss Marlowe,”
she said.</p>

<p>Of course Doris responded that it was more than
good of Lady Despard to have her.</p>

<p>“Not at all; the favor—if there be any—is on your
side,” said her ladyship. “I am simply bored to death
and pining for a companion. I hope we shall get on
together. Mr. Spenser Churchill was quite eloquent in
your praise; and he certainly didn’t exaggerate in one
respect”—and her ladyship let her eyes wander over the
pale, lovely face meaningly—“and I am sure you look
awfully lovable. By the way, what’s your name—I mean
your Christian name?”</p>

<p>Doris told her.</p>

<p>“How pretty. You must let me call you by it. ‘Miss
Marlowe’ sounds so stiff and formal, as if you were a
governess, doesn’t it? Mr. Spenser Churchill says that
you are dreadfully clever; I hope you aren’t.”</p>

<p>Doris smiled.</p>

<p>“I am afraid Mr. Churchill has prepared a disappointment
for you, Lady Despard,” she said.</p>

<p>Her ladyship shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I only hope you won’t be disappointed
in me. I am awfully stupid; but I’m always
trying to learn,” she added, with a smile. “Do you
know Mr. Churchill very well? Is he an old friend of
yours?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Doris, gravely; “I have known him for a
few days only. He was very kind to me; very kind, indeed.”</p>

<p>“I know. He always is,” said Lady Despard. “Such
a benevolent man, isn’t he? I always say that he reminds
me of one of the patriarchs, with his gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
smile, and long hair, and soft voice. Any one would
guess he was a philanthropist the moment they saw him,
wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Doris; “I have seen so few
philanthropists.”</p>

<p>“No. Well, I suppose there aren’t many, are there?
Oh, Mr. Spenser Churchill is a wonderfully good man;
he’s so charitable, and all that. Why, I don’t know how
many societies he is connected with. I try and do all
the good I can,” she added, looking rather bored; “but
my philanthropy is generally confined to subscribing five
pounds; and there’s not much in that, is there?”</p>

<p>Doris was tempted to say: “Exactly one hundred
shillings,” but, instead, remarked that if everybody gave
five pounds poverty would be very much on the decrease.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her ladyship, as if the subject had exhausted
itself and her, too. “How well you look in
black!—oh, forgive me!” as Doris’ lips quivered. “How
thoughtless of me!—that is always my way—I never
think until I’ve spoken! Of course, Mr. Churchill told
me about your trouble. I’m so sorry. I’ve had trouble
myself.”</p>

<p>She glanced at a portrait which hung on the wall as she
spoke, a portrait of a very elderly gentleman, who must
have been extremely ugly, or very cruelly wronged by
the artist.</p>

<p>“Your father?” said Doris, gently.</p>

<p>“No, that is the earl—my husband,” said Lady
Despard, not at all discomposed, though Doris’ face went
crimson. “You think he looks old? Well,” reflectively,
“he was old. He was just sixty-eight when we married.
We were only married two years. He was very good
to me,” she went on, calmly eying the portrait as if it
were that of a chance acquaintance, “extremely so—too
much so, they all said, and I dare say they were right.
He was immensely rich, and he left me everything he
could. I’m afraid I’m wickedly rich,” she added, almost
plaintively; “at any rate, I know there is so much money
and houses and that kind of thing as to be a nuisance.”</p>

<p>A knock was heard at the door, and a footman entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“A person with the tapestry, my lady,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well!” said her ladyship, languidly. “I’ll
come and see it. Would you like to come, or are you
too tired, dear?”</p>

<p>“I should like to come,” said Doris.</p>

<p>They went into the hall, and a man displayed a length
of ancient tapestry.</p>

<p>Lady Despard linked her arm in Doris’, and looked at it
for a moment or two with a very small amount of interest,
then asked the price.</p>

<p>The man mentioned a sum that rather startled Doris,
but her ladyship nodded carelessly.</p>

<p>“Shall I buy it?” she asked of Doris.</p>

<p>Doris could scarcely repress a smile.</p>

<p>“I—really I am no judge,” she said. “I don’t know
whether it is worth the money or not.”</p>

<p>Lady Despard laughed indolently.</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that, of course it isn’t worth it,” she said,
with a candor which must have rather discomfited the
man. “Nothing one buys ever is worth the money, you
know; but one must go on buying things; there’s nothing
else to do. Yes, I’ll have it,” she added to the
man, and drew Doris away.</p>

<p>“Now, I’ve kept you with your things on quite long
enough,” she said. “You shall go upstairs. I’ve got
some people coming to tea—it’s my afternoon—but you
needn’t come down unless you like; I dare say you’ll be
glad to rest.”</p>

<p>Doris was about to accept the suggestion thankfully,
but, remembering her new position, said:</p>

<p>“I am not tired; I shall come down, Lady Despard.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said her ladyship, touching an
electric bell. “Send Miss Marlowe’s maid, please.”</p>

<p>A quiet, pleasant-looking maid came to the door, and
Doris followed her through the hall, and up a winding
staircase of carved pine, and into a daintily-furnished
room.</p>

<p>The maid brought her a cup of tea, and leaving Doris
to rest for half-an-hour, returned to show her down
to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>As they made their way to it, Doris heard the sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
of a piano and the hum of voices, and, a footman opening
the door, she saw that the room was full of people.</p>

<p>She made her way, with some little difficulty, to Lady
Despard, who was seated at a small table, evidently
merely pretending to superintend a tea-service, for the
footman was handing around cups supplied from something
outside, and more capacious than the tiny kettle
on the table, and her ladyship looked up and smiled a
pleasant little welcome.</p>

<p>“You have come down, after all?” she said, making
room on the settee beside her. “This is my new friend,
Miss Marlowe, your grace,” she added, addressing a
stout and dignified-looking lady near her, the Duchess
of Grantham.</p>

<p>Her grace surveyed Doris through a pair of gold eye-glasses,
and inclined her head with ducal condescension,
and Lady Despard introduced several other persons in
the circle.</p>

<p>“We are going to Florence together,” said Lady Despard,
“though why Florence I haven’t the slightest idea;
it’s a whim of my doctor’s. I don’t feel the slightest bit ill,
but he says I am, and he ought to know, I suppose.”</p>

<p>The room, which had seemed to Doris quite full when
she entered, appeared to get still fuller. People came,
exchanged a few words with Lady Despard, took a cup
of tea, strolled about and talked with one or the other,
or listened to some one who sang or played, and then
wandered out. Everybody appeared either languidly indifferent
or horribly bored. Doris, as she leaned back,
half-hidden by Lady Despard’s elaborate tea-gown on one
side and the voluminous folds of a plush curtain on the
other, looked on at the crowd, and listened to the hum
and buzz of voices, half in a dream.</p>

<p>Every now and then she heard some well-known
name mentioned, and discovered that the people around
her were not only persons of rank, but men and women
famous in the world of music and letters.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a name spoken that made her heart
leap, and caused her to shrink still further back.</p>

<p>“What has become of Cecil Neville?” asked the
duchess.</p>

<p>Lady Despard shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. Oh, yes, I do. I had forgotten.
He has gone down to stay with his uncle, the Marquis
of Stoyle, you know.”</p>

<p>“Poor Cecil,” commiserated the duchess, with a faint
smile. “How he must suffer!”</p>

<p>“I heard that he’d been obliged to leave England,”
remarked another lady in a subdued voice. “Up to his
ears in debt, poor fellow!”</p>

<p>“Well, he has had a very long rope,” said the
duchess. “It is time he married and settled down.”</p>

<p>“That is just what he is going to do,” said Lady Despard,
laughing. “I heard from Mr. Spenser Churchill—he
is stopping at Barton Towers, you know—that
Lord Cecil is engaged to Grace Peyton.”</p>

<p>The duchess raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“At last! Well, it is a good match, and I’m sure she’ll
be happy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how severe!” said the other lady. “You mean
that he won’t be, your grace?”</p>

<p>“I mean that if I were a man I should think twice
before——” She stopped, as if she had suddenly remembered
the number and mixed character of her audience.</p>

<p>“Oh, she is a charming girl—and so very beautiful,
you know,” said Lady Despard.</p>

<p>“Yes, very,” said her grace, dryly, and changed the
subject.</p>

<p>Doris sat perfectly motionless, and very pale, fighting
against the dizziness which assailed her.</p>

<p>“What is that the senor is playing?” asked the duchess
presently.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” replied Lady Despard,
helplessly.</p>

<p>Doris rose.</p>

<p>“I will go and inquire,” she said, feeling that she had
better seize the opportunity of making herself useful.</p>

<p>Her grace looked after her.</p>

<p>“That’s a very beautiful girl, my dear,” she said,
slowly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she!” responded Lady Despard. “I call her
lovely—simply lovely. I’m awfully obliged to Mr.
Spenser Churchill.”</p>

<p>“Who is she?—where does she come from?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s quite a long story!” said her ladyship, who
was not so simple as to throw down Doris’ history for
her aristocratic friends to worry. “The poor child has
just lost her father.”</p>

<p>“She will create a sensation,” said the duchess, calmly
and emphatically. “I don’t think I ever saw a more
lovely face, or a more graceful figure—excepting yours,
my dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can leave mine out, too!” said Lady Despard,
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Doris made her way through the crowd,
and the duchess’ prophecy was speedily fulfilled. Men
and women, as they made room for the slight, girlish
figure to pass, looked after her with a startled curiosity,
and turned to each other, asking eager questions, some
of which were pitched in a quite high enough key for
Doris to hear. But, with the modest self-possession
which her training had bestowed upon her, she reached
the piano, learned the name of the piece, and returned
to the duchess.</p>

<p>“It is Beethoven’s sonata in G, your grace,” she said
in her low, musical voice.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear,” said the duchess. “It was very
good-natured of you to take so much trouble. Good-by,
Lady Despard,” and as she shook hands with her hostess
she bestowed a smile and a nod on Doris.</p>

<p>Lady Despard laughed.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she said, “you are going to be a success.
It isn’t often the duchess is so amiable.”</p>

<p>Two hours later, Mr. Spenser Churchill, with a smile
that seemed to cast a benediction on everything it lighted
on, was slowly walking down the still warm pavement
of Bentham street, Soho.</p>

<p>Bentham street, Soho, is by no means an aristocratic
thoroughfare, and the eminent philanthropist had to
meander in and out of a crowd of dirty children,
who shouted and sprawled over the curb and pavement,
much to their own delight and the peril of the foot passengers;
but Mr. Churchill seemed quite familiar with the
street and its humors, and, stopping at a house half-way
down, knocked at the door as if he had done it before.</p>

<p>A young and overgrown girl shuffled along the passage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
and answering an inquiry of Mr. Churchill’s as to
whether Mr. Perry Levant was in, nodded an affirmative,
and requested Mr. Churchill to follow her. She knocked
at a door on the first floor, and receiving a peculiarly
clear-voiced “Come in,” opened the door, and jerked her
finger by way of invitation to Mr. Churchill to enter.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the neighborhood in which it was
situated, and the dingy condition of the rest of the house,
this room was comfortably furnished, and indicated the
possession of some amount of taste by its occupant.
There was a fair-sized table, with a large bowl of flowers
in the center, some pictures rather good than bad, a Collard
&amp; Collard piano stood on one side of the small room,
with a guitar leaning against it. Besides the pictures,
there hung on the walls a pair of fencing foils and masks,
and a set of boxing-gloves.</p>

<p>The room was full of the smoke which emanates from a
good Havana, and the smoker was reclining in a comfortable
chair, with his feet on another, and a glass of, apparently,
soda and brandy by his elbow.</p>

<p>He was a young man, who if he possessed no other
qualities, had been remarkably favored by the gods in one
particular; he was perhaps as singularly handsome a
specimen of the human race as it is possible to conceive.
So finely cut and delicately molded was his face that it
would have been considered effeminate but for the mustache
which, like his hair and eyebrows, and the long
lashes that swept the clear olive cheek, was a silky, lustrous
black. It was a face which Van Dyke would have
loved to paint, a face which, once seen, lingered in one’s
memory, and it wore an added charm, a certain devil-may-care,
<i>debonnaire</i> expression which at once attracted
attention and lent it impressiveness.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Spenser, is that you?” he exclaimed, with a
laugh, as he rose and held out his hand, as white—though
not so soft and fat—as the philanthropist’s own. “An unexpected
honor! Sit down! You don’t mind the smoke,
do you?” he asked, as Mr. Spenser Churchill coughed two
or three “wow, wows” behind his handkerchief. “Rather
thick, isn’t it? The room’s small, you see, and I’ve been
smoking for—oh, Lord knows how long! Have anything?
Brandy and soda, eh? All right!” and, going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
the window, he leaned out, and called some instructions
to an urchin below.</p>

<p>“My dear Percy, isn’t that—er—rather a public way of
procuring refreshments?” said Mr. Churchill.</p>

<p>The young fellow laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps it is,” he admitted. “But it saves
trouble, and they’re used to it! There are always some
youngsters outside glad to earn a penny, and the ‘Pig and
Whistle’ keeps a very good article, so they say! Have a
cigar?” and he pushed a box toward him. “You’ll find
them all right, I think. And now, what brings you to the
aristocratic regions of Soho?”</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill lit his cigar and took two or
three preliminary puffs before answering, the young man
leaning against the mantel-shelf in graceful abandon, and
watching him with a faintly-amused curiosity; then the
great philanthropist said, in his soft, dulcet voice:</p>

<p>“I have come to make your fortune, Percy!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">AN EXTRAORDINARY PROPOSAL.</p>


<p>“Oh you have come to make my fortune!” said Percy
Levant. “Pardon me, but that sounds rather—funny!”
and he regarded Mr. Spenser Churchill with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“Funny!” echoed the philanthropist, in an injured tone,
“why ‘funny’? I trust I have always proved myself your
friend and well-wisher, my dear Percy?”</p>

<p>The young man smiled again, and stroked his silky
mustache with his white, long, artistic-looking hand.</p>

<p>“Yes—oh, yes! I didn’t mean to be offensive, but you
must allow that people don’t generally go about making
other people’s fortunes—that’s all. Pray proceed. I’m
all impatience, and grateful by anticipation! Goodness
knows my fortune needs making very badly!” and he
glanced round the room, and down at his shabby velvet
jacket, which hung over a chair, with a little grimace.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, my dear Percy, if I remark that the poverty
which you lament may be as much your fault as your
misfortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“I dare say,” he assented, with good-tempered indolence;
“you mean that there is not enough of the busy
bee about me, Mr. Churchill?”</p>

<p>The philanthropist shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you have not been industrious, my dear
Percy. Let us for a moment review your position.”</p>

<p>“Review it for half-an-hour if you like,” said the young
fellow. “It won’t hurt me, and it will probably amuse
you. Meanwhile, here’s something that won’t hurt you
and will amuse both of us,” and he opened the door to the
urchin who had brought the liquid refreshment. “Go
ahead while I mix. Plenty of brandy in yours, eh?”</p>

<p>“Here you are, my dear Percy,” said Mr. Churchill,
blandly, “in the possession of youth and health, and—shall
I say—remarkable good looks——”</p>

<p>“Say what you like. You’ll excuse my not blushing.”</p>

<p>“And in addition to those great advantages, a wonderful
talent for one of the fine arts. I believe, my dear Percy,
that you are a musician of a high order——”</p>

<p>“Thanks again! Here’s your health!” interjected the
young fellow. “Yes, I can ‘play a bit, and sing a bit,
and jump Jim Crow.’ As to being a musician——” he
shrugged his shoulders and smiled.</p>

<p>“You play and sing like an artist, my dear Percy, and
most young fellows so highly endowed as you are would
have made a name for themselves and a place in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Instead of which, here I am in dingy Soho, with the
last two quarters’ rent unpaid, and forced to borrow a
five-pound note from my dear friend, Mr. Spenser
Churchill,” he said, lightly.</p>

<p>The philanthropist shook his head.</p>

<p>“What good will a five-pound note do you, Percy?”</p>

<p>“Well, ten pounds would certainly do me more good.
Are you going to make it ten?”</p>

<p>“I will make it much more than ten if you will listen to
me and—er—promise to follow my advice. Just consider
your position, as I say, my dear Percy. Have you no ambition?
Surely you, with your great gifts and youth and
good looks, must feel that this is not the place for
you——”</p>

<p>“That I am wasting my sweetness on the desert air.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Just so. I often feel it; but once having got lost in the
desert, it’s rather difficult to find one’s way out, you see.
Have I no ambition?” The black eyes flashed, and the
clear olive tint of his complexion grew warm. “Of course
I have! What do you take me for—a mule, a packhorse?
Why, man, I never see a well-dressed man of my own age
but I envy him his clothes; I never lean over the railings
in the park and watch the fellows riding by but I envy
them their horses and their acquaintance with the pretty
girls—the daughters and wives of swell people; I never
pass a good club but I feel that I’d give ten years of my
life to be a member and one of the class to which it belongs.
Do you think I live in this stifling den from choice?
Do you think I dine on a sixpenny plate of meat, and drink
porter, sit in the gallery of a theatre, and wear old clothes
because I like doing it?”</p>

<p>He drew himself up to his full height, and flashed down
upon his observant listener for a second, then relapsed into
his old lounging attitude, and laughed musically.</p>

<p>“Why do you come here with your Arabian Nights’
kind of speeches and stir me up! Bah, it’s too hot for
such mental exercise,” and he sank into a chair and folded
his hands behind his head. “No, Churchill, I am in the
desert, and there I shall stick.”</p>

<p>“Unless some friendly guide extends a helping hand
and leads you out,” said the philanthropist. “I can quite
understand your feelings, my dear Percy, and I must say
they are very natural ones. You are, without flattery,
formed by nature to adorn a higher sphere than your
present one. I don’t think any of the young fellows you
envy could do greater credit to their wealth and position
than you could do. Seriously, I think you were cut out
for better things than teaching the piano to the daughters
of the inhabitants of Soho and its neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. I was intended for the heldest son of a
hearl,” said Percy, sarcastically, “but there happens to be
a hitch somewhere.”</p>

<p>“And suppose I tell you that I can undo that hitch,
that I can give you a helping hand to better and higher
things; in short, to repeat myself, to make your fortune!
Think of it, my dear Percy. Plenty of money, the entrance
to good society, horses to ride, club doors thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
open to you, choice wines, men of rank for friends, and a
world ready to welcome with outstretched hands good-looking
and accomplished Mr. Percy Levant!”</p>

<p>The young fellow regarded him with the same incredulous
smile, but there was a light of subdued eagerness in
his eyes, and a warmer color in his face.</p>

<p>“You ought to go into the house, Churchill,” he said.
“I don’t mean the workhouse, but the House of Commons.
I suppose you learn all this kind of thing at your charitable
public meetings? I’ll come and hear you some of these
days; they tell me you make uncommonly good speeches.
Well, go on. How is this fortune of mine to be made,
and—excuse my bluntness—why are you so anxious to
make it?”</p>

<p>“A very natural question, my dear Percy, and, believe
me, I am not at all annoyed by it. I intend to be perfectly
frank and open-minded with you——”</p>

<p>Percy Levant smiled, and got another cigar.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Churchill, but the idea of your being
frank rather tickled me. The spasm has passed,
however; proceed. Is it a new gold mine you are going
to ask me to become a director of? Or have you invented
a new washing machine, and want me to travel for it?
What is it?”</p>

<p>“It has always seemed so strange to me,” resumed Mr.
Spenser Churchill, ignoring the interruption, “that you
have never turned your attention to matrimony.”</p>

<p>The young fellow stared at him, then laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p>“You think that the palatial dimensions of this room are
too large for one individual; that I should be more comfortable
if I shared my sixpenny plate of meat and thread-bare
wardrobe with another? My dear Churchill, you
might as well ask a limping, footsore tramp why he
doesn’t turn his attention to riding in a carriage and pair!
Matrimony! Good Lord! I am not quite out of my
mind!”</p>

<p>“But your wife need not be poor, my dear Percy. She
may be rich in this world’s goods——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I didn’t think of that; and you suggest that
there are hundreds of wealthy heiresses who are dying to
become Mrs. Percy Levant; perishing with the desire to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
bestow their hands and fortunes on the music teacher of
Soho!”</p>

<p>“You would not be the first man who has married
money,” said the philanthropist, smoothly. “But let me
be more explicit, my dear Percy. By one of those strange
chances, which are indeed providential, I happen to be
acquainted with a young lady who would, in all respects,
make you a most suitable wife.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Spenser Churchill, gravely, “the circumstances
of the case are peculiar, not to say romantic. The
fact is, I am that young lady’s guardian, not exactly such
in a legally qualified sense, but by—er—an unfortunate
accident; and, as her guardian, I am naturally desirous of
promoting her present and future welfare. Ah, my dear
Percy, how sacred a trust one undertakes when one accepts
the care of a young and innocent girl!” and he
looked up at the ceiling with a devout sigh.</p>

<p>Percy Levant smiled with mingled mockery and amusement.</p>

<p>“Very nice sentiments,” he said. “But go on. And
this is the young lady you have in your eye for me, is it?”</p>

<p>The philanthropist nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“I confess it, my dear Percy. I have considered the
question in all its numerous bearings, and I am convinced
that I shall be promoting both her future welfare and
yours by—er—bringing you together.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant stared at him.</p>

<p>“This grows serious,” he said. “And may I ask if
this young lady is ‘rich in this world’s goods,’ as you so
beautifully put it?”</p>

<p>“She is—or, rather, she will be,” replied Spenser
Churchill, leaning forward, and speaking in a lower tone,
and with his eyes fixed on the other man’s face with a
keen, yet covert watchfulness. “I said that there were
peculiar and romantic circumstances in the case, and one
of them is this, that the young lady has no idea of the
wealth which will some day be hers.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Percy, curtly, “she hasn’t, eh? Yes, that’s
peculiar, certainly. I suppose there is no doubt about the
golden future, eh?”</p>

<p>“It is as certain as that you and I are in this room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“And the romance—where does that come in?”</p>

<p>“Her story is a singular one. Her name——” he
stopped suddenly, and smiled blandly, “but perhaps I’d
better reserve that for a while, my dear Percy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’d better,” rejoined the young man, sarcastically.
“I might go in for the speculation on my own
account, and throw you over! Churchill, for a saint, you
are singularly suspicious!”</p>

<p>“Not suspicious, my dear Percy; say careful, perhaps
cautious,” suggested the philanthropist, with an oily
smile.</p>

<p>“All right; choose your own word! Go on.”</p>

<p>“The young lady’s career has been a singular one; she
has been an actress.”</p>

<p>Percy whistled and stared.</p>

<p>“But she is a lady in every sense of the word,” continued
Spenser Churchill, slowly and significantly. “She
has left the stage, acting on my advice, and in consequence
of the death of her only relative, and is living now with
some dear friends of mine. With the exception of myself,
she has no one to turn to for advice and assistance.
I am her sole guardian, and—I may say—friend. She
will, I am sure, be guided entirely by me, and that is why
I am so anxious to provide for her future welfare.”</p>

<p>“By marrying her to a needy adventurer,” finished
Percy Levant, with a smile.</p>

<p>“No; to one who, though deficient in the energy which
achieves greatness by its own strength is, I am sure, a
man of honor,” said Spencer Churchill, suavely.</p>

<p>Percy Levant stared at him with a curious smile.</p>

<p>“This is amusing and romantic with a vengeance,” he
said. “And the young lady—of course she is as ugly as
sin?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill was about to answer in the negative,
and dilate upon Doris’ beauty, but he stopped himself and
made a gesture of denial with his hands.</p>

<p>“By no means, my dear Percy. This, I will say, that
she is refined, accomplished, amiable——”</p>

<p>“And quiet in single or double—especially double—harness?”</p>

<p>“In sporting parlance, my dear Percy, that exactly describes
my charming ward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>The young man took a turn up and down the room, and
then, resuming his old attitude, looked down upon the
smooth face of the tempter with a curious and half-troubled
regard.</p>

<p>“You don’t offer me a penny for my thoughts,
Churchill, and so I’ll just make you a present of them. I
am wondering—what—the—devil—you are going to gain
in this business. Wait a moment. You come here and
offer this young girl to me—is she young, by the way?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>“To me—a penniless man, without position or anything
else that makes a man eligible for a husband——”</p>

<p>“You forget your youth and good looks—your undoubted
talents, dear Percy,” murmured the philanthropist.</p>

<p>“A most undesirable match in every way,” went on the
other, taking no notice of this interpolation. “Why do
you do it? Of course, you have some game——”</p>

<p>“My dear Percy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense. For Heaven’s sake, let us have no
hypocrisy. You offer to sell this girl to me, with her
fortune in the future—what is the price I am to pay for
it?”</p>

<p>“If you insist upon putting it with such—may I say—barbaric
directness——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. I want the thing plain and distinct. I
don’t suppose it is for any love of me that you come, as
you say, to ‘make my fortune!’”</p>

<p>“Not altogether; though I have always regarded you as
a very dear friend, Percy.”</p>

<p>The young man made a movement of impatience.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know! But you have some object in
view; what is it? You don’t want me to believe that I am
to give you nothing in return for a wealthy wife. What
is it?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill drew a paper from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Really, it is marvelously like Faust and Mephistopheles,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“If that’s a document I am to sign, it really is,” assented
Percy, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>“Well, I shall want your signature, my dear Percy, but
only in ordinary ink—only in ordinary ink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“What does it contain?” asked the young fellow. “One
moment before you tell me. If it is anything detrimental—anything
that would interfere with the happiness of this
young girl, you can put your precious paper back in your
pocket and light your pipe with it.”</p>

<p>“Right, quite right; your caution does credit to your
heart and honor, my dear Percy,” said Spenser Churchill.
“I say nothing of the injustice you’ve done to me by
your suspicion. I forgive you! In a word, this is a little
bond by which you undertake three things. To marry
the young lady when I shall request you, and not till then;
to keep the marriage secret until I give you permission to
disclose it, and on your wedding day to pay me ten thousand
pounds, or give me a bond for that amount.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” demanded Percy Levant, staring at him
with knitted brows.</p>

<p>“Yes; and I don’t think the conditions over hard. Consider,
my dear Percy; I don’t think you would have a
chance of knowing who the young lady is without I tell
you, you certainly haven’t of marrying her without my
assistance; as to the secrecy of the affair—why, that is not
a great hardship; and for ten thousand pounds, believe
me, my dear Percy, that it will be but a bagatelle to the
man who shall marry my ward.”</p>

<p>“She will be very rich then?”</p>

<p>“Very rich.”</p>

<p>“How am I to know that this is not a trick of yours,
my good Churchill?—that I may marry this <i>protégée</i> of
yours, and wake up to find that it is ‘beggar mated to
beggar’?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill nodded a smiling approval.</p>

<p>“A very proper question, very proper. If you will look
over this bond, you will see that the payment of the ten
thousand pounds is contingent upon the young lady’s becoming
possessed of at least twenty thousand a year. Do
me the favor of perusing it; it is very short and very
simple.”</p>

<p>“And very sweet,” said Percy, and he rapidly ran over
the paper. “I see you have left a blank where the young
lady’s name should go.”</p>

<p>“Which I will fill in when you have signed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“Ah! How long will you give me to consider this extraordinary
proposal of yours?”</p>

<p>“Exactly five minutes,” said Spenser Churchill blandly;
“and excuse me, my dear Percy, if I say that that is four
minutes too long! My dear young friend, consider! A
young, refined, accomplished lady, with a future fortune
of at least twenty thousand a year—and you hesitate.
Are you so fond of Soho, and this rather—excuse me—squalid
life of yours? Think what a vista this opens before
you? You are ambitious. I present you with a
golden ladder by which you may climb to any height you
please. What are your prospects now, save those of a
lifelong drudgery with the workhouse at the end? You,
whose gifts warrant your taking your place among the
flower of the land——”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait!” interrupted Percy. “I can’t think with
your drivel buzzing in my ears! I want to think! Man
alive, I can scarcely believe that this is sober earnest, and
if it were not for the price you exact, I should find it
impossible to do so; but now I see your game, or part
of it——” he wandered to the piano as he spoke, and
dropping into his music chair, abstractly let his hands
stray over the keys.</p>

<p>“I think more easily to music,” he murmured, dreamily.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill watched him in silence for a few
minutes, then he said:</p>

<p>“Time is up, my dear Percy. Is it to be ‘Yes,’ or
‘No?’”</p>

<p>The young fellow rose from the piano; his face was
pale, and his eyes glowing with a strange excitement.</p>

<p>“I cannot resist it!” he said, in a low voice, whose tremor
belied his faint smile. “You are right—more right
than you guessed—when you said I was ambitious. I am
sick and weary of this life of squalid drudgery. I feel
as if I would sell my soul—perhaps I am doing it!—to
get out of it. Give me the paper and I’ll sign it!”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill spread it on the table, and Percy
Levant snatched up a pen and wrote his name.</p>

<p>“There!” he said, pushing it from him, folding his
arms, and looking down at Spenser Churchill with an
almost defiant light in his dark eyes. “And now what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
next? I am all attention! Who and where is my future
bride, and when shall I see her?”</p>

<p>“Her name is Doris Marlowe,” said Spenser Churchill,
softly, writing the name in the blank left for the purpose
as he spoke. “She is at present acting as companion to
Lady Despard, and you shall see her in a day or two.”</p>

<p>“Doris Marlowe!” repeated Percy Levant. “Doris
Marlowe; it sounds pretty, ‘but a rose by any other name,’
etc.; and she is acting as companion to Lady Despard, is
she? And has no suspicion of the wealth that will be
hers? Churchill, are you sure that this is not a fiction
born of your too fertile imagination?”</p>

<p>“You will see in a day or two,” said Spenser Churchill.</p>

<p>“It is really genuine? And what is the plan to be
adopted? You will, I suppose, introduce me as a prince
traveling incog., a millionaire in embryo, a something
brilliant enough to dazzle the eyes of the young lady and
carry her fancy captive? Is this to be the line?”</p>

<p>The philanthropist shook his head with an indulgent
smile.</p>

<p>“No, my dear Percy; I’m free to admit that that is the
kind of thing most men would do; but I think that you
and I are too wise, not to say too honorable, to adopt
such a course of deception.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant laughed sardonically.</p>

<p>“Pardon; I forgot that you were a man of high principle,
and a light of Exeter Hall. Well, what will you
do?”</p>

<p>“I shall tell the truth,” said Spenser Churchill, with a
virtuous uplifting of the eyes. “I shall introduce you to
Lady Despard as a musical genius—you are a genius, you
know, my dear Percy!—struggling against the difficulties
and obstacles insuperable to poverty and—er—that kind
of thing. Lady Despard is never so happy as when she
is assisting struggling talent, and she will receive any one
whom I recommend; dear Lady Despard! The rest I
leave to you. If you cannot find a way to Miss Marlowe’s
heart, then I will confess that I am very much
mistaken in you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for your flattering opinion,” said Percy, with
a short bow. “I will do my best—or my worst, which is
it? Meanwhile, touching that ten pounds!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>“You shall have it with pleasure,” said Spenser Churchill,
and he took a note from his purse and handed it to
him with a benevolent smile. “Do not spend it——”</p>

<p>“In riotous living! No, father patriarch, I won’t; I
will buy myself some decent clothes, and get my hair cut,
for I’ve noticed that your Lady Despards take a great deal
more interest in struggling genius when it is clean and
neatly dressed.”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill nodded.</p>

<p>“You know the world, I see, my dear Percy. I think
that is all we need say. We thoroughly understand each
other——”</p>

<p>“I thoroughly understand you,” returned the young
fellow; “whether you understand me is quite another
matter.”</p>

<p>“I think I do, I think I do,” murmured Spenser Churchill,
blandly. “I think that you will do your best to win
the game which will secure you a charming wife and future
independence. Good-by, my dear Percy. Don’t let
the new suit of clothes be too resplendent; remember that
you are a poor young man of genius.”</p>

<p>“I’m not likely to forget the poverty,” said Percy,
slowly. “Good-by. Mind how you go downstairs; there
are generally from twenty to thirty children asleep on
them at this hour, and the parents, strange to say, have an
unreasonable objection to having them smashed.”</p>

<p>“I will take care,” said the philanthropist, and, with a
murmured benediction, he ambled out.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">AN ART PATRON.</p>


<p>“Dear me, how interesting!” said Lady Despard.</p>

<p>It was the third day after Doris’ arrival, and they were
sitting at breakfast in a small room, beautifully cool and
shady, and furnished with an elaborate simplicity which,
while it avoided all garish color, was fresh and bright.
A great bowl of roses stood in the centre of the table,
from which rose a long fountain of perfumed water.
Curtains of the faintest blush-pink threw a warm tint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
upon her ladyship, who, in her morning gown of delicate
chintz, looked like one of the Dresden shepherdesses
which stood on the mantel-shelf. Doris, in her white
morning frock, with its deep black sash, was the only
patch of decided color—if white can be called a color—in
the room, but, beside Lady Despard’s rather insipid prettiness,
her fresh young loveliness looked like one of the
roses in the bowl.</p>

<p>She looked up from the coffee cup she was filling from
the great silver urn with a faint smile of curiosity. In
three days she had learned all that there was to learn of
Lady Despard’s character, and had grown to like her.
As for her ladyship, she had already taken to the beautiful
girl and her quaint, graceful ways and soft, musical
voice, and, twenty times in each of the days, had congratulated
herself and blessed Mr. Spenser Churchill on
having sent her such a treasure.</p>

<p>“Really very interesting!” she repeated, turning over
the note she was reading, and regarding it with a pensive
smile. “It is from our friend, Mr. Churchill, dear,” she
said; “one of his charming little letters. The good that
man does in a quiet, unobtrusive way, is really astounding!”</p>

<p>“What has he been doing now?” asked Doris, quietly.</p>

<p>“Why, he has written asking me to help him in assisting
a young friend of his who has had a great deal of
trouble and all that. He is a great musician—that is, he
ought to be great, you know—but he is poor and friendless,
and Mr. Churchill wants me to take him by the hand.
He says that I have such immense influence in the arts
and musical world that I can do anything. Of course
that’s nonsense; that is only his nice way of putting it.
But there’s the note. Just read it out, dear.”</p>

<p>Doris took the letter and read it. It was a charming
little composition, as Lady Despard had said, and in the
pleasantest way told the story of struggling genius, which
only needed Lady Despard’s patronage to rise to the
heights of success and fame. Might he bring his young
friend to see dear Lady Despard? Perhaps, if he might
suggest, and her ladyship was disengaged, she would
kindly ask them to dinner. He was quite sure she had
only to know his dear young friend, Percy Levant, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
feel an interest in him for his own sake, and the sake of
the art of which dear Lady Despard was so distinguished
a patroness.</p>

<p>Charmingly worded as was the epistle, Doris, as she
read it, felt a strange and vaguely indefinite want of faith
in it; an incredulity for which she at once took herself
to task, as she reminded herself that Mr. Churchill was
only doing for the young man that which he had done
for her.</p>

<p>“It is a nice letter,” she said, handing it back. “Shall
you ask him, Lady Despard?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, dear; I think so,” said her ladyship. “I
don’t know that I can do much for the young man; you
see, we go to Florence in a week’s time. I might give a
concert; and so introduce him to the musical people; but
I daresay Mr. Churchill has a plan ready—he is always so
systematic. I wonder what the young man is like?
Percy Levant is the name, isn’t it? Sounds Greek, doesn’t
it? I hope he isn’t a foreigner; they generally smell so
of tobacco, and it’s so dreadfully difficult to understand
them; and they are not always presentable. There was a
Signor Something-or-other, an artist they got me to patronize,
and he used to swear dreadfully in Spanish, which
no one understood, fortunately.”</p>

<p>“Then it did not so much matter,” said Doris.</p>

<p>“No,” said her ladyship, pensively. “I forget what became
of him; I think he got into debt, and went back to
Spain. There is one of his pictures in the saloon. I
hope this young man is presentable. These young geniuses
are often so—so <i>gauche</i>, and wear such old clothes.”</p>

<p>Doris could not help laughing at her ladyship’s doubts
and fears.</p>

<p>“But genius covers a multitude of sins, doesn’t it?” she
suggested, and Lady Despard brightened up.</p>

<p>“So it does; and, after all, if he should be a little rough
why we can point out that all clever people are eccentric.
Didn’t Dr. Johnson eat sweet sauce with his fish, and use
his knife when he ought to have used his fork?”</p>

<p>“I think he did,” said Doris.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Lady Despard, as if that settled
it. “Just write a line and tell Mr. Churchill to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
him to dinner to-night! I think”—doubtfully—“that
we’d better not have anybody!”</p>

<p>“In case this genius should eat with his knife,” said
Doris, with a laugh; and presently she rose and, going to
a davenport, wrote the required note.</p>

<p>Lady Despard, with her head on one side, watched her
with pensive admiration.</p>

<p>“How lovely you look in that pose, dear,” she said.
“You certainly have the loveliest profile! And how
quickly and—and easily you write! It takes me no end
of a time to get my sentences together, and the spelling—I
suppose you can spell like a dictionary?”</p>

<p>“Not quite so well,” said Doris, with a smile; “but fortunately,
there aren’t many words of ten syllables required
for this note,” and she handed it for Lady Despard’s
inspection, but her ladyship extended both hands
with a gesture of refusal.</p>

<p>“No, dear; I don’t want to see it, and won’t! I can
trust to your taste and discretion, and shouldn’t think of
being so rude and presuming as to read it! I’m sure it’s
everything that’s nice!”</p>

<p>Doris laughed again.</p>

<p>“You are not very hard to please, Lady Despard,” she
said, with a little flush.</p>

<p>“I should be, if I were not pleased with you, you little
snake charmer,” responded her ladyship, leaning over her
and gently pulling the tiny, shell-like ear. “And now
let’s go for a drive! I want you to get some roses in
those pale cheeks of yours. I think you are looking better
already, do you know?”</p>

<p>“I should be very ungrateful if I were not,” said Doris.
“But hadn’t I better tell the butler that these two gentlemen
are coming to dinner?”</p>

<p>“I declare you think of everything!” exclaimed her
ladyship. “You must have been wonderfully trained,
Doris!”</p>

<p>A faint flush rose to the pale cheeks, and then left it
all the paler for the swiftly passing color.</p>

<p>“Poor people learn to be thoughtful. The dear friend
to whom I owe everything, Lady Despard, spent all his
life in tender devotion to me!”</p>

<p>“There, I’ve made you nearly cry!” exclaimed her ladyship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
putting her arm round her. “What an awkward
idiot I am! But I’ll be more careful, dear; I will, indeed.
And now go and put on that pretty bonnet of
yours, and we’ll go and work havoc with the hearts of
those foolish young men who hang on the rails in the
park.”</p>

<p>Doris gave the butler the necessary information. Although
she had only been three days in the house, Lady
Despard had almost handed over the management of it
to her, and the servants had commenced to look to her
for their orders. It was a strange change from her old
life of dependence and excitement, but it was a change
which Doris found very grateful; the quiet of the magnificently-appointed
house gave her a sense of repose
which she needed greatly, and but for the memory of her
loss of Jeffrey, but for the dull, aching pain which smote
her heart whenever she thought of the man who had
stolen her heart in Barton meadows, and tossed it almost
contemptuously back to her, she could have been happy.</p>

<p>All day long she strove to put the memory of Cecil
Neville away from her, but it haunted her sleeping and
waking, and a great dread assailed her that all her life
she should strive for forgetfulness and find it not.</p>

<p>As they drove in the park she leaned back in the carriage,
and—lost to all sense of the crowded drive and the
long lines of pedestrians, nearly all of whom plucked off
their hats to the well-known Lady Despard—let her mind
wander back to Barton meadows. She did not observe
that she attracted as much attention as pretty Lady Despard
herself, and woke with a start when her ladyship,
with an arch little laugh, said:</p>

<p>“I never got so much notice before! I wonder why
it is. Can you guess, Doris?”</p>

<p>“I? No,” said Doris, innocently.</p>

<p>“Really no? Well, for a really pretty girl I think
you are the most modest I have ever met, my dear.”</p>

<p>Doris laughed and drew farther back.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed her ladyship. “I’ve put my foot
in it again! Never mind, dear, we’ll go home now; I’m
tired of bowing; besides it’s scarcely fair to me to do all,
when half ought to be your share.”</p>

<p>Long before the evening Lady Despard had forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
about the invited guests; but Doris dressed early and arranged
some flowers in the small dining-room in which
the meal was to be served; and thinking that it would be
required, arranged as well as she could the music which
lay in a confused heap in the rare Chippendale canterbury.
Presently Lady Despard came down, fresh from
the hands of her maid, in a costume of Worth’s, with
which she had been entirely satisfied until she saw Doris’
simple frock of black lace with a yellow rose nestling in
its bosom for her only ornament.</p>

<p>“How nice you look, dear!” she exclaimed, taking her
by the shoulders and holding her at arms’ length. “Now
I wonder why it is that you always seem just perfectly
dressed. That neat little frock of yours is simply exquisite,
while mine looks all furbelows and fuss. Where
did you learn to dress like that?”</p>

<p>Doris could have answered, “At the best of all schools,
the theatre;” but instead, she smilingly put the question
by and praised the other’s handsome costume.</p>

<p>They were still talking when a footman announced Mr.
Spenser Churchill and Mr. Percy Levant. Lady Despard
gave a little start.</p>

<p>“Bless me!” she exclaimed, “I had forgotten them!”
and she glided forward to receive them. Doris turned
aside for a moment to pick up a flower which had fallen
from a vase, then looking round, found Mr. Spenser
Churchill waiting with extended hand.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Marlowe!” he purred, pressing her
hand and smiling down upon her with a perfect wealth
of benevolence; “I’m so glad, so glad to see you again.
Let me introduce my friend, Mr. Percy Levant. May
I?”</p>

<p>He stepped on one side, and Doris, looking up, saw a
tall, graceful young man, with a face almost perfectly
handsome; and as she noticed the well-cut and carefully
severe style of his evening dress, she felt surprised and
amused. This aristocratic gentleman, with the face of a
Greek god, must have startled Lady Despard, with her
doubts and fears.</p>

<p>“Miss Doris Marlowe, Percy,” said Mr. Spenser
Churchill, glancing at him sideways and with keen
watchfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Percy Levant did not start, but the quick flash of his
eyes and a certain quiver of the delicately-formed lips,
sufficiently indicated the surprise which fell to his share.</p>

<p>He had imagined a girl, plain almost to ugliness; not
only plain, but shy and diffident, and—as he would have
put it—bad form; a dark, colorless, governess kind of
creature; and this vision of perfect grace and youthful
loveliness startled him almost to bewilderment. He
bowed low to hide the faint signs of his discomfiture, and
Doris, just inclining her head, at once moved away.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced, and Lady Despard, talking in
her languidly-glowing style, gave her arm to Spenser
Churchill, leaving Percy to escort Doris.</p>

<p>The dinner was served on the oval table, and the little
party—which would have seemed cold and formal in the
larger apartment, with its huge table and splendid furniture—was
made to appear pleasant and homelike.
Spenser Churchill and Lady Despard did all the talking
for some time, and Percy Levant only joined in occasionally;
but his silence was perfectly self-possessed, and
without a touch of the <i>gaucherie</i> or awkwardness and
want of breeding Lady Despard had so much dreaded.</p>

<p>Every now and then he let his splendid eyes wander to
the lovely face beside him, and each time the amazement
overwhelmed him, although he sat apparently so calm.
This exquisite creature had been sold to him by Spenser
Churchill! This beautiful girl to be his wife! He
caught himself once or twice looking round the room with
a close scrutiny, as if to convince himself that he was
awake and not dreaming. But he could not sit there silent
all through the dinner, and at last he forced himself to
address her.</p>

<p>It was only some trivial remark about the weather, but
it seemed to him that his voice trembled with the emotion
with which his heart literally throbbed.</p>

<p>Doris responded in her soft, quiet voice, and the sound
of it somehow lulled the storm within him and gave him
confidence. He found himself talking to her more freely,
and each moment the spell her unexpected beauty and
grace cast upon him grew stronger. To listen to a
commonplace from Doris was delightful enough, but she
could talk something better than commonplace; and Percy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Levant, the adventurer, the man who “knew the world,”
was again startled to find that Mr. Spenser Churchill’s
ward was, young as she looked, well read in subjects of
which most women were utterly and sublimely ignorant.
And yet she talked so modestly, so diffidently that her
knowledge was an added charm.</p>

<p>He started when Lady Despard, rising, said:</p>

<p>“The butler knows the claret you like, Mr. Churchill; I
shall leave you to his tender mercies. Mr. Levant, we
will have some tea for you when you come into the drawing-room,
so don’t expect any to be sent in.”</p>

<p>He opened the door for them, and then sank into his
chair, let his head fall upon his bosom, his lips tightly
compressed.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill filled his glass and remained silent
until the butler had left the room, then he said, with a
smile:</p>

<p>“Well, my dear Percy, what do you think of my dear
young ward?”</p>

<p>Percy Levant raised his head and looked at him with a
curious expression.</p>

<p>“Give me some wine,” he said; then, after he had
drank a glass, he demanded, almost sternly: “Why did
you not tell me?”</p>

<p>“Tell you what?” asked Mr. Spenser Churchill, with a
chuckle. “I told you she was a charming young
lady——”</p>

<p>“And you wished me to think that you lied in saying
so,” retorted the other. “Why did you not tell me that
she was as beautiful as—she is?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill chuckled again.</p>

<p>“My dear Percy, I thought that a little surprise would
not come amiss. If I had told you that she was
pretty——”</p>

<p>“Pretty!”</p>

<p>“Well, beautiful—lovely—you would not have believed
me!”</p>

<p>“No, I should not,” he said, curtly. “Don’t say any
more. I want to think! Great Heaven, she is like a
dream! Stop! Don’t talk, I say; I’m not equal to any
of your smooth platitudes at present. Let me be in
peace!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly, my dear Percy,” he said. “Yes,
I can understand your astonishment. This claret is very
fine——”</p>

<p>“No more!” said Percy, rising and taking a step or two
across the room, with his arms behind him, his head bent
upon his breast again. “Let us go to them.”</p>

<p>“I’m quite ready,” said Spenser Churchill, smiling with
intense enjoyment.</p>

<p>They went into the drawing-room. Lady Despard was
turning over the music, Doris was seated at the tea-table.</p>

<p>“I am trying to find something for you to play, Mr.
Levant,” she said. “We are so eager to hear you play,
Miss Marlowe and I.”</p>

<p>He bowed, and his glance caught Doris’; but she only
smiled.</p>

<p>“Will you not play or sing?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she said; “I should be afraid.”</p>

<p>“Of me? It is I who should fear, for I know from
your conversation that I shall have a musician for a
critic.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, quietly; “I am not a musician. You
will have some tea presently?” and she raised her eyes to
his with the calm politeness of perfect self-possession and
good breeding.</p>

<p class="center">TWO SONG BIRDS.</p>


<p>Percy Levant bowed and went to the piano, and Mr.
Spenser Churchill walked across the drawing-room and
took a seat immediately beside Doris.</p>

<p>“I hope you like my young friend?” he said, in his softest
voice, and glancing affectionately toward him as he
stood by the piano talking to Lady Despard.</p>

<p>“I have seen so little of him,” said Doris, “but he is
very agreeable.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Ah, my poor Percy!” he sighed. “Poor boy! He
has suffered so much—so much! There should be sympathy
between you two, my dear young lady, for he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
known what it is to lose his dearest. I should move your
heart if I were to tell you what sorrow and trouble have
fallen to my poor young friend’s lot, and win your admiration
and esteem for him if I recounted the many
difficulties he has had to encounter. It has been a hard
world for him, a hard life, poor fellow! I do so hope you
and Lady Despard will like him.”</p>

<p>Doris remained silent, but the softly-spoken words had
something of the effect their speaker intended, and she
looked toward the young man with increased interest.</p>

<p>“I think, with the exception of myself, he has scarcely
a friend in the wide world,” said Spenser Churchill, sipping
his tea and sighing. “I am counting so much on
your and Lady Despard’s sympathy, my dear Miss Marlowe!
A word of encouragement from such kind hearts
as yours will go far to console him for the cruel disappointments
he has endured. Ah! he is going to sing, I
see! Now you will see if I spoke too highly of his voice
and abilities.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant was certainly going to sing, but he seemed
somehow loth to begin. For a few minutes his fingers
strayed over the keys irresolutely, then he struck a chord
and commenced.</p>

<p>He had chosen not an elaborate specimen of the flowery
school, but a simple Brittany ballad, and he sang it
exquisitely. Doris, as she listened to the long-drawn
notes that seemed to float on eider wings through the
room, felt a singular sensation at her heart. It was as if
this stranger had defined the trouble of her young life,
and had put it into music! With tightly compressed lips
she sat fighting back the tears that threatened to flood her
eyes, her hands closely clasped in her lap, her eyes fixed
on the ground, unconscious that Mr. Spenser Churchill’s
eyes were covertly fixed on her with a keen watchfulness.</p>

<p>The last notes of the song died away, and Lady Despard’s
soft, languid voice poured out her praise.</p>

<p>“Oh, but that is very, very beautiful, Mr. Levant; and
you have a lovely voice! How kind of you to come and
sing to us! And I am so grateful to Mr. Churchill for
bringing you! You must sing again, must he not,
Doris?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>He had risen and bowed to Lady Despard, but his dark
eyes looked beyond her, and sought Doris’ face.</p>

<p>Her lips trembled, but she forced a smile; taking it as
a request, he returned to the piano and sang again.</p>

<p>Lady Despard was in raptures, but he prevented her
asking for another song by going across to Doris.</p>

<p>“Lady Despard will not play; will you?” he said. “You
are not afraid now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, more than afraid,” she said, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Will you sing with me? Here is a duet!” he said,
quietly, his eyes downcast.</p>

<p>“Do, dear!” said Lady Despard. “Miss Marlowe sings
like a professional, Mr. Levant.”</p>

<p>Doris rose reluctantly, and he led her to the piano.</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser went and sat beside Lady Despard, and began
to talk to her in an earnest but softly persuasive tone.
The two voices at the piano rose and fell in harmony, and
seemed to act as an accompaniment to his.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it beautiful?” said Lady Despard. “Their singing
together is simply delicious!”</p>

<p>“And if your ladyship assents to my proposal, they can
sing together as often as you please!” he murmured, insinuatingly.</p>

<p>She laughed and nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s true! Oh, yes, just as you like. I’m sure he is
most interesting, and such a perfect gentleman!”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes,” said Mr. Spenser Churchill; “I would not
have brought him to you if he had been anything less.
And it is settled, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded her ladyship.</p>

<p>He rose at once and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“I will make all arrangements,” he said, in a low voice.
“Say nothing to him to-night.”</p>

<p>The two men said good-night, and Percy Levant found
himself outside, his brain in a whirl, his heart beating
wildly.</p>

<p>“Well, may one ask your highness what you think of
my ward now?” said Spenser Churchill, softly.</p>

<p>Percy Levant thrust his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Has she been ill, or is it trouble that makes her look
like that?” he asked, in a grave, thoughtful tone.</p>

<p>“Trouble,” said Spenser Churchill. “Poor girl. Yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
she has been ill, too; but she is better, and the change will
completely set her up, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Change?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he purred. “She and Lady Despard go to Italy
next week,” and he smiled as he struck the blow and saw
Percy wince.</p>

<p>“To Italy next week!” He turned upon him. “What
are you scheming? What are you doing? Why did you
take me to see her to-night, if——Do you think I am
made of stone; that, like yourself, I’ve no heart! To
Italy!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Spenser Churchill, “and I have arranged
that you shall go with them——”</p>

<p>Percy Levant started again, and, stopping, confronted
him with a pale, eager face.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly! You are to go with them as—what
shall we say?—friendly cavalier, courier, what you will—anything
will serve as an excuse. What do you say?
Perhaps, after all, you regret your bargain! If so, say so,
and I’ll release you.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant caught him by the shoulder and held him
in a savage grip.</p>

<p>“You—you devil!” he said, fiercely, almost wildly.
“You know that I cannot! If I had not seen her I might
have had the strength; but now——”</p>

<p>He withdrew his hand, and, almost thrusting the other
man away from him, strode on.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A SAD HOME-COMING.</p>


<p>Lord Cecil Neville was a man of his word. He had
pledged himself to remain in Ireland until the mission
he had undertaken was completed, and he meant keeping
his word, though his life depended on it. And it seemed
to him that more than his life, his happiness, hung in the
balance. He had written again and again to Doris, and
had received no answer to any one of his letters. That
they had reached her was evident from the fact that none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
were returned through the post to him. To all his passionate
attempts for an explanation of her silence not one
word came from her!</p>

<p>Life had gone fairly smoothly for Viscount Neville up
to this, and his hot, impetuous nature—inherited from his
mother’s side of the family—found it difficult to endure
the suspense. Many men would have broken their word
and returned posthaste to England and Barton, but a
pledge was a solemn thing to Cecil Neville, and like a
soldier on duty he stuck to his post.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to speak in detail of what he accomplished
in Ireland, but this much may be said, that he
found the people in the right and the agent in the wrong,
and that that agent had a bad time of it! It may be added
that Lord Neville succeeded in a few short weeks in winning
more hearts among the marquis’ tenants than all the
Stoyles for centuries had been able to do, and that before
many days had passed “the young lord,” as he was
called, was regarded as a friend and protector, and many
a faltering voice called down a blessing on his head, and
implored him to remain in “the old country.” The Irish
are a warm-hearted people, quick to resent an injury, but
equally quick in their gratitude for a benefit; this handsome
young nobleman who had relieved them from their
oppressor, and done his best to better their hard lot, received
his reward in the shape of an affectionate gratitude
which he should remember and cherish all his life
through.</p>

<p>The absentee landlord, the man who screws the last
penny from the tenant, and spends it in Paris or London,
has been the curse of the country; and it was because
Lord Neville saw this, and owned it freely, that the people
trusted him.</p>

<p>Often, when he had returned from a day’s inspection of
the estate, and had relieved the oppressed, he wondered
what the marquis would say when he heard what his ambassador
had done! Often when, tortured by an anxiety
respecting Doris’ silence, he spent the night pacing up
and down his room, he vowed that when they were married
they would come and live among these people, who
had welcomed him so readily, and so gratefully recognized
his efforts on their behalf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>But for the constant hard work, the incessant traveling,
Lord Neville would have suffered more than he did; for,
as the days wore on, and no news of Doris reached him, he
began to imagine all sorts of terrible things. One night
he dreamed that she was dead, and woke trembling and
shaking, half-persuaded that he had heard her voice calling
to him.</p>

<p>All day her image haunted him, and he found himself
pulling up his horse, and sitting staring vacantly before
him, recalling her last words, her shy, passionate kiss;
and then he would dash forward, and try and persuade
himself that his letters had, in some way, miscarried, and
that all would be well.</p>

<p>One morning his servant brought him a letter, and he
seized it eagerly, but his face fell as he saw the Stoyle
coat of arms on the envelope.</p>

<p>The letter was from the marquis. It was the first he
had written, though Cecil had sent him a short report of
his proceedings each week, and the contents caused him
to spring from his chair. It said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My dear Cecil, I think you had better come back. It appears
that your course of true love, like other persons, is not running
smoothly.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Stoyle.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>That was all, but it was enough for Cecil. In less than
an hour he was on his way to the station as fast as the
car could carry him. He was fortunate enough to catch
the mail, and, traveling day and night, arrived at Barton
Towers just after dinner. The butler started and stared
at the young viscount’s haggard face and travel-stained
clothes, and in his solemn fashion looked quite shocked.</p>

<p>“Where is the marquis?” demanded Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“In his room, my lord. I’m sorry to say, dinner is
over, but I can serve you——”</p>

<p>“Will you tell the marquis I have arrived, and ask
him to see me, please?” said Lord Cecil, interrupting his
stately periods. “I shall be ready in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>He was scarcely longer, and still pale and wearied-looking,
was conducted to the library.</p>

<p>The marquis was sitting in his easy-chair, wrapped in
his velvet dressing-gown, and looked up with his usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
cold smile, and a slight elevation of the eyebrow, denoted
his recognition of Cecil’s altered appearance.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” he said, giving him the tips of his
thin fingers. “I am afraid you have been rather hurried
in your journey——”</p>

<p>“I came back without the loss of a moment,” said Lord
Cecil, gravely. “I should have come before, but I waited
to complete the business, or until I heard from you——”</p>

<p>The marquis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you have inconvenienced yourself on my
account,” he said, coolly and indifferently. “There was
no reason on earth why you should remain there a moment
longer than you liked——”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil’s pale face flushed, and he made a movement
of impatience, almost of indignation.</p>

<p>“You must have been bored to death—oh, no; I forgot—you
take an interest in those people. Ah, yes. I got
your letters—quite reports, weren’t they? I am ashamed
to say I didn’t read them.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil’s eyes flashed, but he restrained himself with
an effort.</p>

<p>“My lord,” he said, grimly, more firmly and sternly
than he had ever spoken in his life, “I will not trouble you
with an account of my mission—for it was a mission, carelessly
as you ignore it. I am too full of anxiety on another
matter. Will you tell me the meaning of the note
you sent me?”</p>

<p>The marquis stopped again and looked at him with a
faint, puzzled confusion, as if he were trying to remember
what it was he had written; then he nodded.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; I remember. I sent you the note because I
thought you would like to hear some information I received
about Miss Barlow——”</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe, do you mean?” said Lord Cecil, biting
his lips. “What information——”</p>

<p>“Give me time, please,” said the marquis, arranging his
dressing-gown. “Your impetuosity is rather trying.”</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” exclaimed Lord Cecil, clinching his
hands; “why do you torture me like this? You forget—or
do you not forget?—is it from sheer malice that you
keep me in this suspense? You know, I see you know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
that I have not heard from Miss Marlowe; that I fear
some accident——”</p>

<p>“I know nothing of your not having heard from her,”
said the marquis, with perfect coolness; “and I care less.
I wrote to you because I considered that I should do so,
on a point of honor. You were absent on my business,
and it was my duty to let you know what I had heard. I
have always done my duty, and I did it in this case,
though the writing of even a short note is irksome to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, my lord, well?” demanded Lord Cecil, and he
paced to and fro, “what is it? Is she ill?—is she——”
He could not force his lips to utter the word “dead.”</p>

<p>“Ill? Oh, no; I hope not. The fact is, I—I may say
‘No,’ for it is generally known, I imagine, that Miss Barlow—pardon,
Miss Marlowe—has disappeared.”</p>

<p>Dreadful as the word sounded, Lord Cecil drew a
breath of relief, and a smile, a very mirthless one, crossed
his lips.</p>

<p>“Disappeared?” he said, almost contemptuously. “You
mean she has left Barton? That accounts for her not
having received my letters or answered them. Where has
she gone?”</p>

<p>The marquis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I had better tell you what I know; we are getting
rather confused. It appears that Miss Marlowe’s guardian
died suddenly; probably you know this?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil uttered an exclamation of dismay and pity.</p>

<p>“No! I did not know it! I have not heard from her—from
any one! My poor Doris! When—when did he
die?”</p>

<p>“Some time ago—soon after you left, I believe; and
here in Barton. I know nothing of the particulars.”</p>

<p>“And she did not write! Why not, why not?”</p>

<p>“For reasons best known to herself. My dear Cecil, I
am reluctant to shake your faith in this young lady, but I
am afraid I must.”</p>

<p>“What!” demanded Lord Cecil, scarcely understanding.
“My faith in Doris! Go on, sir!”</p>

<p>“It would seem——Pray take a chair; your constant
moving is harassing.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil sank into a chair, impatiently.</p>

<p>“It would seem that the young lady was not very serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
in her little love affair with you. I imagine that that
kind of young person seldom is. How can it be expected
of them? They are actresses by profession. I daresay
she was practicing for a love scene when she was exchanging
vows of perpetual faith with you. Pray don’t
take my suggestion in bad part!” he put in, for Lord
Cecil leaned forward with crimson face. “I am sorry you
should have regarded the matter so seriously! It is a
mistake—I speak with experience—a mistake to take
any woman seriously; they are all daughters of Eve,
and as unreliable as their first mother. Miss Marlowe is
like the rest, that is all!”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me, my lord, what it is you insinuate?”
said Lord Cecil, in despair.</p>

<p>“I insinuate nothing! Why should I? I believe it is
perfectly true, but you can ascertain for yourself, of
course, that she has jilted you, and gone off with her
first, and, pardon me if I add, her more suitable young
man.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil started up, his face pale and working, his
eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“It—it is a lie!” he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>The marquis regarded him with a mixture of curiosity
and contempt, the kind of look with which one might regard
the movements of a strange animal.</p>

<p>“Yes, it may be! I don’t answer for the truth of the
story, as I said.”</p>

<p>“Where has she gone? Who is this—this man? It is
false! I will stake my existence upon her truth! It is a
ridiculous lie!”</p>

<p>The marquis smiled.</p>

<p>“A large stake; too large for so paltry a prize as a
woman’s faith!” he said, calmly. “I have heard that she
has gone to Australia with a man named—named—excuse
me, my memory is very faulty, but, fortunately, I
jotted down the details. I had an idea that you would
like to hear them.” He reached for an elegant-bound
memorandum book as he spoke, and consulted it.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, here it is! ‘Miss Marlowe sailed in the
<i>Orion</i> on the fourteenth, in company with Mr. Garland,
late of the Barton Theatre Royal; engagement at Melbourne.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
The <i>Orion</i>, the fourteenth! I am glad it occurred
to me to jot it down with the particulars.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil stared at him as if he were in doubt
whether he or the marquis was mad, and the marquis,
closing the book, regarded him with a calm, set placidity.</p>

<p>Then Lord Cecil laughed. It was an unpleasant laugh
to hear.</p>

<p>“Who told you this fable?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I got it from Spenser Churchill!” said the marquis,
promptly.</p>

<p>“Spenser Churchill! Spenser Churchill!” repeated
Lord Cecil. “What had he to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Too much,” said the marquis. “Very much against
my advice, he insisted—you know he is a professional
philanthropist?”—with a sneer—“he insisted upon pleading
your cause with the young lady. But it was of no
avail; even so distinguished an individual could not persuade
a woman to keep her faith.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil strode up and down, his physical weariness
and exhaustion playing their part in his mental disturbance.</p>

<p>“It is not true!” he asseverated, vehemently. “It is
not true! Why should Spenser Churchill be mixed up
in this matter? Why——”</p>

<p>“That is easily answered,” said the marquis. “It appears
that he discovered that the young lady’s guardian
was an old friend of his. I don’t know his name——”
which was true. “I don’t know anything more than I’ve
told you; and forgive me for saying so, that, seeing the
reception my information has received at your hands, I’m
very sorry I know so much! I hate and detest this kind
of business. It was bad enough when I took a personal
interest in it, but now——” he shrugged his shoulders.
“It is a pity that the world could not have got on without
women; we men would have been better and happier, believe
me.”</p>

<p>“Where is Spenser Churchill?” demanded Lord Cecil,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Heaven only knows!” said the marquis, shrugging his
shoulders. “In London, possibly, or he may have gone
out on a mission to the Jews, or the Turks, or the Sandwich
Islanders. I neither know nor care, if I may say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
so. And now, hadn’t you better go and get something to
eat? I fear we have exhausted the subject,” and he leaned
back and regarded the opposite wall with an expression
which was intended to indicate that, whether they had
exhausted the subject or not, the subject had entirely and
completely exhausted him.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil regarded him sternly for a moment, as if he
were about to speak, then, with a gesture of farewell,
opened the door and went out. Scarcely had he done so
than the curtains over a door behind the marquis’ chair
fluttered violently, and Lady Grace glided out.</p>

<p>She was pale, and her under lip was caught in her
white teeth, in her endeavor to appear calm and self-possessed.</p>

<p>“Has he gone?” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” replied the marquis. “You heard our interesting
and dramatic dialogue?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“Do you think——” She paused and turned aside.
“Do you think that he cared for her very much?”</p>

<p>His lordship smiled sardonically.</p>

<p>“I should say he was what is termed madly in love
with her.”</p>

<p>Lady Grace moved a little away, out of reach of the
cold, piercing eyes, and a quiver shot over her face.</p>

<p>“Has he left the house, do you think?” she asked.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I should imagine so. I should fancy that wild horses
would not hold him!”</p>

<p>“Where’s he going?”</p>

<p>The marquis smiled indifferently.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea—to Australia, probably.”</p>

<p>She started.</p>

<p>“He would not be so mad!”</p>

<p>“If my opinion is worth anything, I think he is mad
enough for anything! This girl must be extremely
good-looking, Grace!”</p>

<p>She bit her lip till the blood came.</p>

<p>“Y—es, she is,” she assented, as if the admission cost
her an agony. “Oh! yes. And he is going! I thought
he would have stayed the night!”</p>

<p>“And I didn’t,” said the marquis, grimly. “He is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Stoyle, and its not our way to take the loss of our mistresses
meekly.”</p>

<p>“Did you give him the letter?” she asked.</p>

<p>The marquis uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Phew!” he said, with a laugh. “I knew there was
something I should forget. I told you and Churchill
that you’d better play the game yourselves, and that I
should bungle it. You see, I am so unused to intrigues
of this description,” and the great intriguer of his generation
smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Give it to me,” said Lady Grace, as if struck by a
sudden idea.</p>

<p>The marquis pointed to a cabinet.</p>

<p>“It’s there somewhere,” he said, indolently.</p>

<p>Lady Grace opened the door sharply.</p>

<p>“Take care, please,” he said, with a smothered yawn.
“That cabinet is unique, and I have left it to you.”</p>

<p>She made an impatient gesture, caught up poor Doris’
letter, and glided from the room and up the corridor.</p>

<p>As she did so Lord Cecil came out of his room, followed
by his valet, with a portmanteau in his hand, and
wrap on his arm.</p>

<p>“Lady Grace!” said Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“Why, where are you going?” she exclaimed. “I have
only just heard of your return! You are not going
again?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, trying to speak lightly, and force a conventional
smile; “I am as bad as a queen’s messenger.”</p>

<p>She laid her hand lightly on his arm.</p>

<p>“Something’s the matter,” she said, in a low voice.
“What is it? Is it anything you can tell me—anything I
can help you in?”</p>

<p>He shook his head as he signed to his man to go on.</p>

<p>“I have learned bad news, Lady Grace,” he said, as
coolly as he could, but his voice shook as he added, “No,
you cannot help me, and, I fear, no one can!”</p>

<p>She came closer to him, and laid her hand upon his
arm, looking up at him with her magnificent eyes softened
with womanly sympathy.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry! Can you not tell me what it is?
Stay; where are you going?”</p>

<p>“To London,” he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“To London!” She leaned over the balustrade, and
looked at the great clock in the hall. “You have plenty
of time. Stay one moment. Lord Cecil, do you remember
the first night you came?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, gravely.</p>

<p>A faint flush rose to her face.</p>

<p>“And all I said to you? Do you think I should have
spoken to you as I did unless—unless I had liked you?”</p>

<p>“I appreciated your candor, Lady Grace,” he said, in
the same grave tone.</p>

<p>Her hand trembled on his arm.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I am going to be still more candid. I am
going to ask you to try and fancy that you had asked
me to be your wife and that I had refused.”</p>

<p>It was his turn to flush now, and his eyes dropped
under her fixed, earnest gaze.</p>

<p>“Do you know why I say that? It is because you
may not misunderstand me when I ask you—as I do now—to
let me be your friend.”</p>

<p>“I am grateful, Lady Grace——” he began, in a low
voice, but she stopped him.</p>

<p>“Wait. It is no idle, meaningless offer. I will be a
real friend, Lord Cecil, if you will let me. I will prove
that a woman and a man can be friends without being—lovers!
Now, then, trust me, and show me that you
trust me by telling me what this trouble is.”</p>

<p>Her eyes looked so honest, so eager, so trustworthy,
that Cecil—his heart wrung with the misery of suspense
and doubt, his brain heavy and bewildered by fatigue and
harassing anxiety—fell into the net.</p>

<p>“I will trust you, Lady Grace,” he said, and there was
a quiver in his voice which was no discredit to his manliness.
“In a word, I have lost the girl I love.”</p>

<p>“Lost her!” she said, with wide-open eyes. “Ah, yes!
I know! Miss Marlowe, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “Do you know anything? For
Heaven’s sake tell me everything——”</p>

<p>“I will,” she said. “But I have heard nothing more
than this—that she has gone to Australia with—with a
man to whom she was engaged before——”</p>

<p>“And you believe it?” he said, with grave reproach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“No!” she said at once. “I do not believe a word of
it!”</p>

<p>He took her hand and pressed it, all unconsciously, so
that the rings almost cut into her delicate fingers.</p>

<p>“How shall I thank you for saying that?” he exclaimed,
in a low voice, which showed how deeply he
was moved. “They are the first words of comfort, of encouragement!
You do not believe it?”</p>

<p>“No, I am certain it is not true. She has left Barton,
I know, but as to the rest—why, it is too absurd! Shall
I tell you why I do not believe it? Because I have
something for you which will explain all, I’ve no doubt,”
and she held out the letter.</p>

<p>He almost snatched it from her.</p>

<p>“A letter! Why—where—when—how——” And he
stared at her with eager impatience.</p>

<p>“It came while you were away, and I took it. Don’t
be angry.”</p>

<p>“Angry! Has any one seen it but yourself?”</p>

<p>“No one!—no one! I kept it. Of course, I felt that
its safety was of importance to you. I should have forwarded
it to you, but I knew you were moving about,
and I feared it might be lost.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see!” he said, and already hope was displaying
itself in his face and voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, that will tell you where she is, and why she has
gone, no doubt,” said Lady Grace; and with an affectation
of delicate consideration she turned to the great oriel
window, that he might read it undisturbed.</p>

<p>Suddenly he uttered a cry, and, looking round, she saw
him leaning against the balustrade staring at the letter,
which shook like an aspen leaf in his hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it?” she breathed, and her face went almost
as white as his own.</p>

<p>He looked up with a bewildered stare; then, with a
working face, seemed to struggle for composure.</p>

<p>“You—I—we were both wrong!” he said, hoarsely;
“she—she has gone!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” murmured Lady Grace; “don’t say that!
Do not believe it! Oh, Lord Cecil!” and she laid both
her hands upon his arms and looked up at him beseechingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
sympathizingly, as a sister might strive to soothe
and encourage a brother.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, almost inaudibly, and with a catch in
his voice, “it is true—it is true! Great Heaven! and I
loved—I trusted—I——” He turned his head aside for
a second, then faced her, every muscle of his face quivering
under the effort to appear unmoved. “Lady Grace,
the letter proves the marquis’ estimate of women to be a
true one, and mine—Heaven help me!—false! Read it.
No, I cannot! It is the only letter she ever wrote me—it
is sacred! The first and the last! Great Heaven, to
think that she, she!——” and as he recalled the pure and
innocent face, the truthful, trustful eyes that had looked
up so devotedly, so passionately, with such an infinity of
love into his, his voice broke and he could not utter
another word.</p>

<p>“No, do not show me the letter!” she said. “It should
be sacred to you. And I do not believe it yet. Where
were you going, Cecil?”</p>

<p>Her omission of his formal title escaped him at the
moment.</p>

<p>“To London,” he said. “But where”—and he made a
despairing gesture—“it doesn’t matter. Nothing matters
now!” and he forced a rueful smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it does matter,” she said. “There may be
some mistake—there is, there must be! It is useless to
ask you to remain here, I feel that. Go to London,
Cecil, and go to the offices of the <i>Orion</i>. Go and see if
her name is on the passenger list. I will stake my faith
in the honor and truth of my sex that it is not!”</p>

<p>He seized her hand and pressed it again.</p>

<p>“How can I thank you?” he breathed. “Yes! Ah,
what woman’s wit will do! I will go to the office!”</p>

<p>“And you will let me know? You will not forget—your
friend!”</p>

<p>“I shall never forget all you have done, all you have
been to me this day, Lady Grace,” he said, fervently; and
with a grave solemnity that might well have become one
of the old knightly Stoyles whose pictures looked down
on them, he raised her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>A deep red suffused Lady Grace’s face, and she drew a
quick, sharp breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“Go, then!” she said, her hand resting on his clingingly,
“and come back with good news!”</p>

<p>He nodded, and with the letter in his hand, ran down
the stairs. Lady Grace leaned over the balustrade and
looked at him, her heart beating wildly, her eyes flashing
with suppressed excitement. She looked at that
moment like one</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose soul and brain with keen desire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Burnt in a flame of all-consuming fire.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, as the door closed behind her, and she heard the
retreating sound of the dogcart, she drew herself upright,
and, pressing her hand to her forehead, she
thought intently.</p>

<p>“A wrong step now, a false move, and—and I lose
him!” she murmured. “Oh, if I were there with him; if
I could be sure that Spenser Churchill had got her out of
the way! Ah!”</p>

<p>The ejaculation was forced from her lips by an idea
worthy of a woman. Without waiting a moment she
sprang up the staircase to her own room.</p>

<p>“Find the next train to this,” she said to her astonished
maid. “Don’t stand staring! There may not be a
moment to lose. Pack a bag—a small bag—and order a
brougham. Say nothing to anybody but the groom of
the chambers, and tell him to keep his tongue quiet—give
him this!” She handed her a couple of sovereigns.
“Wait! I want this to go to the telegraph office. Stay!
No! I will take it myself as I go!”</p>

<p>“The office is closed, my lady,” said the maid, looking
up from the portmanteau she had already commenced to
pack.</p>

<p>Lady Grace’s face fell, then it cleared again.</p>

<p>“Of course! All offices are closed by this time; none
will be open till to-morrow! No matter. Give me a
telegraph form.”</p>

<p>She sat down and wrote quickly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He will be at the <i>Orion</i> packet office the first thing to-morrow.
Act. Meet me at the square at ten.</p>
</div>

<p>Two hours later she was seated in the train following
that which had borne Lord Cecil to London, and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
telegram lay at the office to be forwarded to Mr. Spenser
Churchill at eight the next morning.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil reached his chambers in the gray of the
summer morning, looking like a man who had received
sentence of death, and yet hoped that by some chance a
reprieve might save him.</p>

<p>Not until the train started had he remembered that
the steam packet-office would not be open until ten
o’clock, and, yielding to the respectful entreaties of his
man, who was deeply attached to him, and saw with dismay
the change which the last few days had made in
him, Lord Cecil threw himself on the bed. But he found
it impossible to rest there, and spent the long hours pacing
up and down, vainly trying to draw encouragement
from a remembrance of Lady Grace’s assertion of faith in
Doris.</p>

<p>“She believed in her, and she does not know her; how
much more should I trust in her, who do know her?
And yet this letter!” and he took it out and read it for
the hundredth time.</p>

<p>Long before ten he had a bath, drank a cup of coffee
to appease his valet, and, dressing himself, went down
in a cab to the office of the Australian Steamship Company.</p>

<p>He was there before the office opened, and had to wait
for a quarter of an hour. While he was pacing up and
down, smoking a cigar, with fierce impatience, a quietly-dressed
man, in a brown pot hat, sauntered up, glanced
at him casually, and passed by; then, as if he had remembered
something, took out his watch, and returned
at a quick pace, so quickly, indeed, that he almost ran
against Lord Cecil, and offered profuse apologies.</p>

<p>A few minutes after ten a yawning boy wound up the
iron shutters, and Lord Cecil went into the office.</p>

<p>“I want to know——” he commenced; but the boy,
struggling with a yawn which threatened to bisect his face,
said, languidly:</p>

<p>“Clerks not here yet; don’t know nothing myself.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil inquired when they would be there, was
told five minutes, ten, perhaps; lit another cigar; was informed
by the intelligent lad that he mustn’t smoke in
the office; flung the cigar away, and strode to the door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
nearly knocking over the quiet-looking gentleman in the
brown hat, who was looking in at the door inquiringly.</p>

<p>Ten minutes—a quarter of an hour passed, and at last
a clerk arrived; and Lord Cecil made for him as if he
were going to demand his life.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me whether a lady of the name of Marlowe
sailed by the <i>Orion</i>, for Melbourne?” he began,
with suppressed eagerness.</p>

<p>The clerk eyed him with the charming impassibility
and indifference which distinguishes some of his class,
and read a letter which lay before him before answering.</p>

<p>“You will find her name in the passenger list if she
did,” he said at last.</p>

<p>“Then, for Heaven’s sake, give me the passenger list!”
said Lord Cecil, with suppressed fury. “I have been
waiting——” He pulled himself up on the verge of an
outbreak, and the clerk, with a great deal of dignity, got
down a huge ledger and leisurely found the proper page.
Then he proceeded to read off the names; there seemed
a million of them to poor Cecil, who leaned against the
counter, his eyes fixed on the book, his lips tightly compressed.</p>

<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Browne, Mr. and Miss Tompkins, Mr.
Garland, Miss Doris Marlowe. Yes, she sailed,” said the
clerk.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil gripped the counter hard, and stared in a
dazed, blind way at the open page.</p>

<p>“Mr. Garland! Miss Doris Marlowe!” Great Heaven,
then the marquis had spoken the truth, and she had
jilted him; had left him for the other man—this actor.
In a moment he recalled the young fellow, the handsome
Romeo, who had played so well to her Juliet. And she
had gone with him! She—Doris! Doris, the girl he
loved; whose faith, and honor, and truth—-ah, and innocent
purity of mind and soul—he would have sworn by.</p>

<p>The clerk stared at his white face and compressed lips
curiously. It was not the first time anxious inquiries
had been made respecting missing persons at the office,
but no one had taken the information given as this handsome
young gentleman took it. He seemed, as the clerk
put it afterward, when recounting the incident to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
fellow-clerks, “as if he were struck dumb, and deaf, and
blind.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything else I can tell you, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil raised his head and regarded him vacantly.</p>

<p>“Anything else? No,” he said, with a grim smile.
“That will do, thanks. When will the <i>Orion</i> arrive?”</p>

<p>The man referred him to a calendar and told him.</p>

<p>“There or thereabouts,” he said. “She’s a fine vessel.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so I’ve heard,” said poor Cecil, not knowing
what he was saying; and, wishing the clerk good-day, he
made his way out.</p>

<p>At the door he paused and took off his hat in a confused
kind of way, as a man does who has received news
which is either too good or too bad to be realized all at
once; and as he stood there, he felt a hand upon his
shoulder. Looking round, he saw that it was the persistent
personage in the brown hat.</p>

<p>“Lord Cecil, Viscount Neville, I believe?” he said,
quietly and respectfully enough.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am Lord Neville,” said Cecil. “What do you
want?” he added, with weary surprise.</p>

<p>The man took a paper from his breast pocket.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to trouble you, my lord,” he said, “but I’m
a sheriff’s officer, and I have to arrest you on a debt warrant.”</p>

<p>“Arrest me?” said Lord Cecil, not with the surprise
the man doubtless expected. Lord Cecil would not have
been surprised that morning if he had been arrested for
murder. “I don’t understand——”</p>

<p>“If you’ll step aside for a moment,” said the man,
very respectfully, indeed apologetically, “I will show
you. These are the items,” and he took some papers
from a greasy pocketbook, and read them off.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil recognized them as some old debts, bills
and I O U’s, which he had almost forgotten.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is right, I expect,” he said, gravely, and
very wearily. “But I thought,” he said, as the idea occurred
to him, “that there was no arrest for debt now?”</p>

<p>The man smiled almost pityingly.</p>

<p>“Nor is there, my lord; it’s called contempt of court
now! You have been ordered to pay these sums by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
court, and you haven’t done it, therefore it’s contempt,
and they take you on that.”</p>

<p>“Ordered to pay them?” said Cecil. “When? I have
heard nothing of it.”</p>

<p>The man looked incredulous of so much innocence, for
a moment, but, after a long and steady scrutiny of the
pale, grave face, with its frank, honest eyes, he looked
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Hem! I don’t quite see. Ah, yes, I do! These
processes have been served on your lawyers, no doubt,
my lord. Haven’t they let you know?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lord Cecil, quietly. “I have been away
in Ireland. I’ve seen no letters——”</p>

<p>“It’s plain enough, my lord,” said the officer. “You
ought to have had your letters forwarded. The court
has been under the impression that you’ve neglected the
order out of sheer contrariness, and so these creditors
have got the warrant. Ah, my lord, no end of mischief
comes of you swell gentlemen not opening your letters.
I’m very sorry, but here’s the warrant, and I’m bound to
execute it.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil did not by any means fully comprehend the
man’s meaning even yet.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?” he said, gravely.
“Ah, I see, you want to take me to prison!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no; my lord, certainly not,” said the officer,
respectfully. “If your lordship will settle the amounts;
the banks are open, and close at hand. We might walk
to your lordship’s bank, and you could give me a check.”</p>

<p>“Let me see the paper,” said Lord Cecil; then his face
flushed. “I have not one quarter of this in the bank,” he
said, quietly.</p>

<p>The man looked rather nonplussed.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what’s to be done,” he said, looking
at the pavement with a frown. “Your lordship has
got friends—I’ll go anywhere—to your lordship’s rooms,
while you communicate with them. Of course, I must
have the money. Duty’s duty. As a soldier, your lordship
knows that.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil nodded.</p>

<p>“Come to my rooms,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>The man called a cab, and they got into it and were
driven to Clarges street.</p>

<p>To attempt to describe the valet’s face when he saw the
kind of person whom his master had brought back with
him would be difficult, and quite impossible to picture it
when Lord Cecil requested him to get this person breakfast.</p>

<p>“I will telegraph to my uncle, the Marquis of Stoyle,
while you are eating it,” he said; but the man looked
up reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Will you send your man, my lord?” he said, significantly,
and Lord Cecil started, for he realized that he
was a prisoner. He sent the telegram, requesting the
marquis to order his bankers to pay the sum to Lord
Cecil’s order; then went and stood by the window and
looked out on the street; and in a few minutes he had
forgotten the presence of the officer and all pertaining
to him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Garland—Miss Marlowe,” rang through his brain
to the exclusion of anything else.</p>

<p>A couple of hours passed, and the return telegram
arrived. It was short and emphatic:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sorry. Quite impossible.—<span class="smcap">Stoyle.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Lord Cecil read it, and, with a grim smile, tossed it
across the table to the officer, who was enjoying himself
with one of Cecil’s choicest cigars and a glass of whisky
and water. He looked aghast.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, my lord! What’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Lord Cecil, shrugging his
shoulders, very much as the marquis might have done.</p>

<p>“But—look here, my lord, this is getting serious!
Isn’t there any other friend? Surely, your lordship must
know ever so many friends as would only too gladly lend
you the money! Think, my lord!” Lord Cecil shook
his head. “I am afraid it is of no use thinking,” he said;
“I cannot pay the money, and——” He leaned against
the window, and smiled. “But there is no hurry, I suppose?
You can finish your drink.”</p>

<p>Before the man could reply, a voice floated through
the open window.</p>

<p>“Lord Cecil!”</p>

<p>He started, and looked out. A hansom cab was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
pulled up opposite his door, and Lady Grace was leaning
out and looking up at him.</p>

<p>“Lady Grace!” he cried, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes; it is I,” she said. “Will you come down? I
want to speak to you. I could not wait.”</p>

<p>He made for the door, but the man rose.</p>

<p>“My lord! my lord!” he said, reproachfully.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil turned pale; then he laughed, and going to
the window, said, grimly:</p>

<p>“Lady Grace, I cannot come down to you. Please go.
I will see you—to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She seemed to hesitate for a moment; then he saw her
alight, and a moment or two afterward, she stood in
the doorway of his room.</p>

<p class="center">IN THE HOUR OF NEED.</p>


<p>It need scarcely be remarked that it is not usual for
young ladies unattended to pay gentlemen visits at their
chambers. Scandal is only too ready to seize upon the
slightest excuse for the exercise of its malignity, and the
fact, if it were known, that Lady Grace Peyton had been
seen in Cecil Neville’s rooms would be quite sufficient to
set evil tongues wagging.</p>

<p>All this flashed across Cecil Neville’s mind as she
stood in the doorway, a picture of queenly beauty which
seemed to light up the room, and made the sheriff’s officer
stare with all his eyes.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil went forward, a slight flush on his face
denoting his embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Lady Grace!” he said.</p>

<p>Then he stopped suddenly, remembering that it would
be well not to mention her name before the man.</p>

<p>She bit her lip and looked from one to the other as
she gave him her hand.</p>

<p>“I—I thought you were alone!” she said, in a low
voice full of confusion and anxiety.</p>

<p>The officer rose and made a slight bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll step outside, my lord,” he said, respectfully, and
he did so.</p>

<p>“I—I did not know,” faltered Lady Grace, looking
after him. “Have I done anything very wrong in coming?
I did not stop to think. I was so anxious that I
thought I would come up to town——”</p>

<p>“Will you not sit down?” he said, gravely, and he
placed a chair for her.</p>

<p>She sank into it, and looked up at him.</p>

<p>“What news is there? Have you heard of her? I
can’t tell you how anxious I am! Ah! I see by your face
that something has happened! What is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have had news,” he said, in a low voice. “My
uncle was right, and you and I were wrong, Lady Grace.
Miss Marlowe”—his voice grew grim—“has sailed for
Australia.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no! But alone?” she breathed.</p>

<p>“No, not alone. She went with this Mr. Garland,” he
said, sternly.</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry! What can I say, dear Lord
Neville, to comfort you?”</p>

<p>He smiled wearily.</p>

<p>“Nothing, I am afraid. There is nothing to be said—or
done; I have got to bear it, that is all! I am not the
only man who has been—jilted.” The cruel word left
his lips like a note of steel. “Probably my lot is all too
common. Yes, I have got to bear it!”</p>

<p>“There—there is no doubt about it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“None, whatever,” he replied. “I have been down
to the office and seen the list of passengers, and her
name is among them, together with this man’s.”</p>

<p>“How bad, how heartless, she must be!” she murmured,
indignantly.</p>

<p>He winced and looked aside; even in this, the first hour
of his trouble, he could scarcely endure to hear Doris
thus spoken of.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “I can scarcely believe that
she has done what she has; it seems more like a dream
than sober reality. But I suppose every man in my
case feels like that.”</p>

<p>“If I could only do something for you!” she murmured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
leaning forward, and looking up into his face with
the sympathy which, coming from a woman, is so precious
to a man, especially when the woman is young and
beautiful.</p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully,” he said, trying to speak in a conventional
tone to hide the acuteness of his suffering,
“but, as I said, no one can do anything, except it is our
old friend, Time. I shall ‘get over it,’” and he smiled,
as the Spartan may have smiled while the fox was gnawing
at his bosom.</p>

<p>“You look very tired,” she said, after a moment’s
pause. “What will you do with yourself to-day? Will
you—don’t think me obtrusive!—but will you come and
drive with me—come, and do something? I am so
afraid that you will sit here and mope.” She glanced
round, then started and looked up at him, as if with a
sudden remembrance of the situation. “But I am forgetting!
I—I ought not to be here, ought I? Lord
Neville, you don’t think ill of me for coming?” and the
color rose to her face, and she dropped her eloquent
eyes as if with a sudden shame.</p>

<p>“Think ill of you, Lady Grace!” he echoed, impetuously.
“What, for coming to try and help a poor fellow
with your sympathy? I can’t tell you how grateful I
am! It was a kind action, which not one woman out
of a thousand would have done!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she said, in a low voice; “that is it! One
woman in a thousand! Tell me, Lord Cecil, and tell me
the truth! I have been foolish and—and forward in coming
here to you like this?”</p>

<p>If he had told to her the truth, Lord Cecil would certainly
have been obliged to admit that she had been foolish;
but what man in his position ever does make such an
admission?</p>

<p>“I think you have done a very kind action, Lady
Grace,” he said, gravely. “And—shame to him who
thinks ill of it! Besides——” He hesitated.</p>

<p>She looked at him with an intelligent flash of her eyes.</p>

<p>“You were going to say that no one need know. You
forget the cabman and the man outside.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil bit his lip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“At any rate, no one else need know,” he said. “The
cabman does not know who you are——”</p>

<p>“I engaged him from just outside our own house,”
she said, in a voice of concern.</p>

<p>“Cabmen are discreet,” he said, to reassure her.</p>

<p>“But the man—who is he, Lord Neville?”</p>

<p>He wiped his moustache, and made a great business
of it.</p>

<p>“Oh! a man I do business with,” he said; “nobody of
any consequence. He does not know you, I’ll answer
for it.”</p>

<p>She drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“Not until this moment have I realized what I have
done,” she said, and he saw her lips tremble.</p>

<p>“Don’t be uneasy, Lady Grace,” he said, soothingly.
“Let me discharge this cabman and call another——”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said; then she added, tremulously;
“but will you not come back with me?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will!” he assented, promptly, and he
seized his hat. “I will come and see Lord Peyton——”</p>

<p>“My father is away, yachting,” she said; “but come
as far as the house, if you will.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” Then he stopped and turned crimson, and
stared at her, the picture of a man embarrassed beyond
measure.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it now?” she exclaimed, almost clasping
her hands.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing,” he hastened to reassure her,
though his voice was anything but reassuring; “only
that I have just remembered that I cannot leave the—the
house just at present. The fact is, I have important
business with this man, and—and—oh, Lady Grace, I am
so sorry! Don’t misunderstand! I’d give all I’m
worth”—he laughed bitterly, and corrected himself—“ten
years of my life, to come with you, but——”</p>

<p>He turned away, and set down his hat almost savagely.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” she murmured, anxiously, and
there seemed to him a touch of reproach in her voice,
which maddened him. “But I will not ask you to explain.
Good-by,” and she turned away without offering
her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>He sprang forward; then pulled up, and with something
between a groan and an oath, sank into a chair.</p>

<p>She passed out, closing the door after her. On the
bottom of the stairs she found the man sitting with his
hands in his pockets, his hat on the back of his head; but
he sprang up and removed his hat as she appeared. She
made a slight gesture with her hand, and he followed
her to the door; there she turned and, looking at him,
calmly said:</p>

<p>“You are a sheriff’s officer?”</p>

<p>He looked rather surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am, my lady,” he admitted. “I suppose his
lordship told you?”</p>

<p>“No matter,” she said. “Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>His eyes dropped before her steady gaze, and he
looked rather uncertain how to answer.</p>

<p>“I see you do!” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, my lady. You see, I get about a good
deal,” he added, apologetically, “and anybody who is
accustomed to seeing much of the upper ten, knows Lady
Grace Peyton.”</p>

<p>She looked round as he spoke her name, and bit
her lip.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am Lady Grace Peyton,” she said; “and I
have come to see Lord Cecil Neville because he is in
trouble. I am a very great friend of his.”</p>

<p>The man nodded appreciatively. He took her words
as meaning that she was engaged to Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“He is in great trouble, is he not?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, he is,” he replied. “That is, he is in just
a bit of a hole at present! It’s not much of a hole, but
he seems as if he couldn’t get out of it.”</p>

<p>“You have arrested him for debt, have you not?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes I have,” he admitted, almost reluctantly.
“I suppose he has told you, and it’s no use my denying
it, my lady, especially if—begging your pardon for the
liberty—you are going to help him; and I suppose you
are?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, quietly. “What is the amount?”</p>

<p>He handed her the paper.</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“All I’m concerned with,” he replied, significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“I will pay it,” she said, after a moment’s reflection.
“Will you come with me to the bank?”</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, then put on his hat with a
certain amount of emphasis.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will! It’s not usual, but I’d trust your ladyship
to the utmost.”</p>

<p>“Walk down the street and beckon the cab to follow,
please,” she said. “I do not wish Lord Neville to see
us together. I do not wish him to know anything of
what I have done. Can I trust you?”</p>

<p>“You can, my lady,” he said.</p>

<p>They drove in silence to the West End branch of the
bank, which was only half-a-mile off, and Lady Grace
drew a check for the amount and handed it to the officer,
who took it with unfeigned pleasure.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you now how glad I am you came, Lady
Grace,” he said. “If ever I’ve had a disagreeable job,
this one of Lord Neville’s was one. Most of ’em treat
one like dirt, and give a lot of trouble into the bargain.
I’ve met with rough usage sometimes, my lady; but Lord
Neville, though he’s young and full of go, so to speak,
has behaved like a gentleman, and treated me as if I
had the feelings of a man. Yes, he’s a nobleman, every
inch of him, and—I hope you won’t laugh, my lady!—but,
I declare, if I’d had the money, I’d have lent it him
myself rather than taken him off. There’s the receipt.”</p>

<p>She thought a moment, holding the paper in her hand;
then she said:</p>

<p>“Take it to Lord Neville, and put an end to his anxiety;
but, remember your promise, and do not tell him from
whom you got the money.”</p>

<p>Then she lowered her veil, and left him.</p>

<p>He walked back to Clarges street—almost ran, indeed—and,
opening the door in response to Lord Cecil’s
gloomy “Come in,” entered, and pantingly surveyed him
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Lord Cecil, grimly. “You are agreeably
surprised at finding me here still! Most jailbirds would
have taken advantage of your absence and flown, would
they not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they would,” assented the man, emphatically.
“But I spoke the truth when I said you were a real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
nobleman. And I didn’t hurry back because I was
afraid. No!—I knew you’d wait! You are the right
sort, you are, my lord!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Lord Cecil, curtly; “and where have
you been?”</p>

<p>“Begging your pardon, my lord, that’s a secret; but
I’ve been on business, and there it is!” and he laid the
discharge on the table.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil took it up indifferently; then, when he had
realized its purport, he started and flushed.</p>

<p>“Why!—what does this mean?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“It means that the claim is settled, and that you are
a free man, my lord,” said the officer, warmly; “and if
you’ll allow me to offer my respectful congratulations
and a word of warning——”</p>

<p>“A word of warning?” said Lord Cecil, confusedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord. This business—though it’s all right
in a legal way—has had a curious feature or two about
it. I mean that there’s been some underhand work
going on: Jews, I expect. You see, though the amounts
were owing to several persons originally, they’ve been
bought up by some one—some one who’s got a grudge
against you! Can you guess who it is?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil shook his head.</p>

<p>“I know no one who has any grudge against me,” he
said, still bewildered.</p>

<p>“Very well, my lord, all the more reason that you
should keep your eyes open. At any rate, you’re clear
of ’em now, and I wish you good-day. You won’t be
sorry to see the back of me, I daresay.”</p>

<p>“Stop!” exclaimed Lord Cecil; and the man turned,
with his hand on the door. “Some one has paid this
money. Who was it?”</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>“A friend who wishes to remain unknown, my lord,”
he said.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil stared at him.</p>

<p>“A friend who—nonsense, man! I must know! Who
was it? The marquis?”</p>

<p>The man shook his head again.</p>

<p>“I’m pledged, my lord,” he said. “But it wasn’t the
marquis—confound him!” he added, under his breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“Not the marquis? I know of no one else—stop!”
His face went crimson. “The lady who was here”—he
sprang forward and seized the man’s arm in a grip like
that of a vice—“was it she?”</p>

<p>“I’m pledged, my lord. I’ve given my word. I have,
indeed!”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil dropped his arm.</p>

<p>“You have answered,” he said, in a low voice, and the
officer, after a moment’s hesitation, nodded ruefully and
went out.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil paced up and down the room with the discharge
in his hand. The excitement of the last twenty-four
hours, the suspense respecting Doris, the arrest, and
now this sudden release, added to his physical exhaustion,
told upon him fearfully.</p>

<p>That he owed his escape from the disgrace of imprisonment
to Lady Grace he could not doubt. Doris, on
whose truth he would have staked his life, had jilted him;
his uncle, the marquis, had, in his hour of trouble, disdainfully
deserted him and cast him aside and this
woman, whom he had regarded as a perfect type of
worldliness, had come to his aid and freed him.</p>

<p>She had done more than that, for she had risked her
reputation in her desire to show him her sympathy with
him. She had done that which only one woman in a
thousand would have dared to do: come to his room
alone and unprotected.</p>

<p>A man is never so tender as regards his heart as in
the moment when he has been betrayed by one woman
and succored by another; and Lord Cecil’s heart
throbbed with a painful sense of admiration and gratitude
toward this woman of the world, the girl whom
he had always regarded as just a society beauty, who
had, at such fearful risks to her own name, come to his
side in his dark hour.</p>

<p>“May Heaven forget me if ever I forget it!” he said
to himself, not once nor twice only. “What shall I say
to her? What am I to do to show her how I feel about
it? And where shall I get the money to repay her? I
can’t let her be the loser; I must pay her; but how—but
how?”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lady Grace had reached her house in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
Grosvenor Square, and, going to the drawing-room,
found Mr. Spenser Churchill seated in an easy-chair,
reading the last annual report of the Sweeps’ Orphan
Home.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said, looking up with a bland smile.</p>

<p>She sank into a chair, and began pulling off her gloves,
her eyes downcast, her face pale and thoughtful.</p>

<p>“It is done,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said, with a nod of satisfaction. “You have
seen him, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have seen him,” she said, in a low voice. “I
was only just in time.”</p>

<p>He smiled with an air of complacency.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I timed it carefully,” he said. “I knew
he would be at the office the moment they opened it; I
calculated that he would be arrested shortly after, and
that he would go to his rooms and telegraph to the
marquis, allowing a little over an hour—say two—for
the answer, a refusal, as the dear marquis and I arranged;
and there you are, you see!” and he laughed,
softly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said; “you arranged it very well.”</p>

<p>“Ye—s! And the news at the office. Is he satisfied?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is satisfied. He saw her name. It did not
occur to him to ascertain if she had really sailed; if it
had——” She paused, significantly.</p>

<p>The philanthropist laughed with unctuous enjoyment.</p>

<p>“But he didn’t, you see, my dear young lady. That
is just the little risk one has to run; but, after all, it isn’t
much risk. Why should he suspect that any one should
go to the trouble and expense of booking a passage for
Miss Marlowe? And you found him in bonds—just
starting for prison?” And he rubbed his hands together
with renewed enjoyment. “Poor Cecil! Really, it is
very sad that one should be compelled to take such
strong measures. And yet, after all, will not the lesson
be a salutary one? Pride must have a fall, dear lady;
pride must have a fall! And our dear Cecil”—his small
eyes glinted maliciously for a moment—“was very, very
proud! And you paid the money?”</p>

<p>She looked up with a little start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I paid the money. In fact, I have carried out
your instructions to the letter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; you are a courageous girl, dear lady. It is
not every one so well known as you who would so far
brave the consequences as to go to a gentleman’s rooms——”</p>

<p>She looked at him, with a flash in her eyes and with
a tight compression of the lips, but he pretended not to
notice the warning signs.</p>

<p>“Our dear Cecil ought to be very grateful to you;
very! And, if I know his generous nature—and I fancy
I do—I think he must be. Oh, yes, he will never forget
it—never! Why, bless me, if it were known—if, for
instance, any acquaintance had seen you going or departing—what
would not be said?” And he held up his
fat hands.</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, and stood with her hand
pressed against the chair, her bosom heaving, her magnificent
eyes fixed upon him with suppressed fury.</p>

<p>“A word, a hint, just a whisper, is enough nowadays
for the scandal-loving world; and I can just fancy how
delighted the society papers would be with such a dainty
morsel as the incident of a visit to Lord C——l N——l
from Lady G——e P——n. They never print the name
in full; oh, no; but everybody understands——”</p>

<p>“Take care!” she breathed. “Do not drive me too
far!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes; we must take care!” he assented, feigning
to misunderstand her. “We must not breathe a
word of it, of course; must flatly contradict it, if we hear
a hint dropped. But there, dear Cecil would rather die
than admit it!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, between her teeth; “yes, you speak
the truth there; he would rather die than harm should
come to me—to any one—for his sake!”</p>

<p>“Y-e-s, he is so high-minded, isn’t he? And how
does the dear fellow bear this blow? It isn’t pleasant to
be jilted, is it? Is he resigned? I am curious now to
hear how he takes it!”</p>

<p>“Go to him and ask him!” she said, with fine scorn.
“Take care, Spenser Churchill! Up to the present your
schemes have succeeded. You know best how far they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
will carry you. To me it seems that you—and I are
walking on a volcano. What if he should find this—this
girl?”</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe, do you mean?” he said. “My dear
lady, you forget; she is in Australia!” he said.</p>

<p>“Is she in London?” she asked, in a lower voice, and
looking away from him. “If so, and he finds her——”
She stopped, significantly.</p>

<p>He smiled blandly.</p>

<p>“Let me beg of you not to be uneasy, dear lady,” he
said, seriously. “The young lady in question left England
nearly a week ago, and there is no chance of our
friend Cecil meeting her until it is too late.”</p>

<p>“Too late?” she echoed, raising her eyes to his face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he smiled. “Until he is married.”</p>

<p>She let her hand fall from the mantel shelf, and a warm
crimson flooded her face, and he chuckled, unctuously.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure it is time dear Cecil ‘ranged himself,’
as the French say; it really is time he was married and
settled down. Don’t you agree with me? Ah, I see it is
too delicate a subject. Well, good-morning, dear lady.
Accept my profound homage and admiration for your
courage and generosity in our dear young friend’s behalf,”
and with another chuckle he smiled himself out of the
room.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">AS IN A DREAM.</p>


<p>“There is no place like Florence,” said Lady Despard,
in her soft, languorous voice. “One gets tired of London,
and Paris, and Venice! I always fancy, when I’m
there, that I’m living somewhere in Regent’s Park, near
the canal, you know; and, as for the country in England,
you either get burned up by the heat or drowned by the
rain. But Florence”—she paused, and sighed contentedly—“oh,
it’s always delicious!”</p>

<p>She was lying in a hammock, swung between two
laburnums, on the lawn in front of the Villa Rimini, and
she addressed Doris, who sat on the ground, with an
open book in her lap, but with her eyes fixed dreamily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
on the exquisite view, which stretched out in an endless
vista of grassy plains, and violet-tinted hills, over which
the full moon was shedding its silvery light.</p>

<p>The soft evening breeze came to the two women, laden
with flowers, as with an offering; there were flowers
everywhere; in the long beds, starring the velvety lawns;
on the banks, which ran along the limits of the garden;
in huge jardinieres, on the terraces and balconies; on
the plains, which lay like embroidered cloths beneath
them, and over the hills, to which they lent color and
perfume.</p>

<p>It was a land of fairies, a land of beauty, in which every
breath of wind that blew carried with it the memory of
music and song, of laughter and joyfulness. In a word,
it was Florence in the height of her loveliness, crowned
as a bride for her bridegroom the summer, and rejoicing
in her splendor.</p>

<p>The Villa Rimini, with its numerous windows twinkling
with the recently-lit candles, was one of the most
beautiful of the many palatial residences in the “City of
Flowers.” It had been a home of one of the ancient
princes, and when Lady Despard had first seen, fancied
and bought it, was nearly in ruins; but, with the immense
wealth at her command, she had restored it, if not to
quite its ancient splendor, at least to a semblance which
came very near the original reality.</p>

<p>Marble corridors, vast saloons, with rare hangings
and costly frescoes, statues which the Louvre would
gladly have bidden for, antique fountains and priceless
mosaics were all here as in the days when the princely
owners were, indeed, a name and a power in the land.</p>

<p>And here she and Doris had been living a dreamy existence,
a period of lotus-eating, for nearly a month.</p>

<p>There was the usual colony of English in Florence, of
which the Villa Rimini was, by right of its splendor and
the rank and wealth of Lady Despard, the center.</p>

<p>Her hospitality was limitless, and the Salon of the
Princes, as the vast reception-room was called, was every
afternoon the scene of a gathering which almost resembled
a royal levee; while the widely-extending grounds
were open to those fortunate individuals who had procured
an introduction to the wealthy owner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>To the Villa Rimini came also the Florentine nobility;
tall, grave-looking Italians, with their high-bred voices
and polished manners, men whom Doris always pictured
as wearing the silken hose and brocaded tunics of their
forefathers in the old Florentine days, when men wore
shoes almost as pointed as the swords which were always
ready to leap from their scabbards with—or without—the
slightest provocation.</p>

<p>Amidst these surroundings, Lady Despard held what
might, with little exaggeration, be termed a court; but
it might be said, to her credit, the admiration, the adoration
she received did not turn her head, probably because
she recognized the obvious fact that she shared her
throne with the quiet-looking, soft-voiced girl who had
come to her as a companion, and whom she had grown
to regard and love as a friend.</p>

<p>Once, when the reception was over and the two
women were alone, as they were this evening, she looked
at Doris, laughingly, and said:</p>

<p>“Well, dear, tired of all the adulation and worship, or
are you looking forward to to-morrow’s repetition?
Seriously, my dear, I am beginning to be a little jealous;
more than half the pretty speeches this afternoon were
addressed to Miss Marlowe, and your bouquets were
quite as numerous as mine. Beware of vanity, Doris!”</p>

<p>And Doris had looked up at her with the quiet smile,
beneath which always lay an undercurrent of sadness,
and shook her head, as she replied:</p>

<p>“The danger is all on your side, Lady Despard. You
are the sun, I am merely the shadow. Some day some
one will pluck the sun from its place, and the shadow
will be desolate!”</p>

<p>But Lady Despard had laughed placidly.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, dear! I’ve been married once, and,
as the boy said of the prickly pear, ‘No more for me,
thank you!’ But yours is another case altogether, and
I confess that I tremble every day lest you should come
and tell me, with that mouselike little smile of yours,
that one of these men is going to take you from me!
Ah! what a pity it would be!—for we are so happy, you
and I, dear! If girls could only know when they are
well off! But they never do. It’s only when they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
resigned their liberty and given all their heart for about
a quarter of some selfish man’s that they discover what a
fraud matrimony is!”</p>

<p>And Doris had made no reply beyond the quiet,
“mouselike smile,” and a little sigh, which was too low
to reach her companion’s ear.</p>

<p>Not Lady Despard alone, but many another of the frequenters
of the Villa Rimini, have wondered that this
beautiful English girl should be so irresponsive to the
admiration and attentions lavished upon her. Men of
rank and position, for whom the matrons of society
angled unceasingly, paid court to her, needing but a
smile or word of encouragement to lay their titles at her
feet; but the smile nor the word were never extended to
them. As the Princess of Carthage, clad in the mystic
veil, moved, like an unapproachable spirit, among the
suitors at her father’s court, so Doris Marlowe lived,
surrounded by a barrier of reserve which, vague and
intangible as it was, served to keep the most ardent at
arm’s length.</p>

<p>The past alone was to her reality; the present seemed
like a dream; and often she sat beside Lady Despard,
surrounded by a crowd of people laughing and talking,
the voices died upon her ears, and she heard only the
murmur of the brook in Barton meadows, mingling with
the voice of the man who had won her heart and tossed
it aside, shattered and broken forever.</p>

<p>Often she wondered whether he had married the Lady
Grace—whose name, when first she had heard it on his
lips, had sounded like a knell in her ears.</p>

<p>If stone walls do not a prison make, a crowd cannot
destroy solitude, and Doris, in the midst of the brilliant
throng which made the Villa Rimini its center, lived in
a mental and spiritual solitude, on the threshold of which
only two persons ever trod. One was Lady Despard,
whom she loved, the other was—Percy Levant. She
would have treated him as coldly as she did all the
others, but it was impossible. He made it impossible by
never giving her a chance of repulsing him. Since the
evening he had come to Chester Gardens for the first
time he had never paid her a single compliment, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
from his lips alone she never received a single “pretty”
speech.</p>

<p>Although he slept at the inn, he had a luxurious suite
of apartments in the villa, and they met at almost every
meal, and frequently during the day, but his manner to
Doris was one of studious courtesy toned by a reserve
which matched her own.</p>

<p>By the rest he was regarded as the most charming of
men. The women secretly—some of them openly—adored
him for his good looks, which were remarkable
even in that land of handsome faces, and for the exquisite
voice, which was always at their service. The
men voted him a “good fellow,” and were warm in his
praises. The reception from which he was absent always
seemed lacking in its accustomed brightness, and
no dance or outdoor excursion was complete without
Mr. Percy Levant.</p>

<p>Perhaps the air of mystery which surrounded him increased
the interest he awakened. Nobody knew anything
about him, except that he was in Florence to study
music, and, in some vague, unexplained way, to collect
materials for a magnificent and unique music-room
which Lady Despard intended building in one of her
houses, and at some unfixed time in the dim future.</p>

<p>Of himself, and his own affairs and past history, he
was as silent as Doris was of hers; and people who were
at first inclined to be curious accepted his want of a past
and were content to take him for what he was—a light-hearted
waif floating like a bubble on the surface of society.</p>

<p>To the superficial frequenters of the Villa Rimini he
did not seem to have a care and scarcely an object in
life, excepting it were to play and sing at all times and
seasons, whenever Lady Despard requested him.</p>

<p>But Doris was something more than a superficial observer,
and often when, in the early morning or in the
delicious gloaming, she was wandering dreamily through
the flower-scented grounds, she would come across him
pacing moodily beneath the trees, or lying on a bank,
with his head resting on his hands, and his handsome
face darkened by an expression which would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
startled his many friends who thought they knew him
quite intimately.</p>

<p>At such times he would spring up, dispelling his
moodiness instantly, and resume his usual manner; but
the impression he had made remained with Doris.</p>

<p>And, having seen him off his guard, as it were, she
found herself, at odd times, thinking of him. He
seemed as alone in the midst of the pleasure-seeking
crowd as herself. From thinking of him in an indifferent,
casual kind of way, she grew, all unconsciously, to
entertain a vague sort of sympathy for him, which she
would never have been capable of if he had lavished compliments
upon her, as the rest did. She felt convinced
that some shadow lay in his past, and that the ready jest
and the fluent laugh only hid a wound which he was too
proud to permit the world to gape at.</p>

<p>This was the first phase of their relation; the second
began during the second week of their Florentine life.
She became conscious that his presence at the villa contributed
not only to the enjoyment of Lady Despard and
the rest, but to hers!</p>

<p>In an indescribable way he seemed to know exactly
what was wanted at any given moment, and to supply it,
and his thoughtfulness, strangely enough, always appeared
to save trouble to Doris.</p>

<p>From the first day of her coming to Lady Despard,
she had undertaken the arrangement of the flowers in
the various rooms, and she continued to do so in Florence
as in London. The head gardener was accustomed
to send up huge baskets of flowers each morning, which
Doris would set out and arrange in the various vases
and bowls. It was a long task, and one morning he had
entered the salon and found her in the midst of it, looking
rather pale and tired, for the room was hot and close
with the almost overpowering perfume.</p>

<p>“That is a serious business,” he said, in his quiet
fashion.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” she assented, with a smile.</p>

<p>He said nothing more, and passed out; but the next
morning Doris found the flowers spread out on a table,
under an awning, in a shady part of the terrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“Why, how thoughtful of the gardener!” she said to
Lady Despard’s maid, who stood near.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it wasn’t the gardener, miss,” said the girl.
“It was Mr. Percy who brought the table out here; he
did it himself, and put the awning up.”</p>

<p>“It was very kind of him,” said Doris, and when he
came in to breakfast she thanked him.</p>

<p>He bowed, slightly.</p>

<p>“It is cooler out there,” he said, simply, and turned to
speak to Lady Despard at once.</p>

<p>A few evenings afterward a discussion arose respecting
a book that had suddenly leaped into popular favor.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it, Miss Marlowe?” inquired an
old Italian nobleman, whose breast sparkled with orders.</p>

<p>“I haven’t read it, count,” said Doris.</p>

<p>Instantly there was an inquiry for the book, but it appeared
that no one possessed a copy.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must read it! I’ll send to London for a
copy,” said the count.</p>

<p>An hour afterward some one wanted a song from
Percy Levant, but he was nowhere to be found, but
presently one of the young men, of whom there were
always more than a sufficient quantity at the villa, came
in with a:</p>

<p>“I say, Lady Despard, if Mr. Levant doesn’t mind,
he’ll lose that jolly voice of his! I’ve just met him in
the hall, wet through; it’s raining cats and dogs, you
know! Can’t make out where on earth he’s been, don’t
you know!”</p>

<p>A little later, Percy Levant sauntered into the room,
and Doris saw him laughing and talking with one and
another on his way to the piano, and she thought the
lad must have been mistaken; but, when all had gone,
and she was going upstairs, he came to her, with something
in his hand.</p>

<p>“There is the book they were talking about,” he said.
“I fancy it isn’t worth the fuss they are making about it.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” said Doris.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I was lucky enough to find a copy in the town,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“Then it was for that you went out and got wet!” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
exclaimed. “It was very kind, but—was it worth while,
Mr. Levant?”</p>

<p>“I thought so, and think so still, but I may be mistaken,”
he retorted, with his peculiar, half-cynical smile.
“Good-night,” and he moved away, as if the incident
were done with.</p>

<p>Gradually she began to realize that in any difficulty he
was always at her side. A big picnic was to be arranged,
and Lady Despard, who had got accustomed to leaving
everything to Doris, had done so on this occasion, and
Doris was up early in the morning to give the necessary
orders. She found that all the preparations had been
made. Mr. Percy Levant had interviewed the major
domo, and the thing was done.</p>

<p>When Doris thanked him, he smiled, and courteously
cut her short.</p>

<p>“I don’t deserve any thanks,” he said. “You see, my
Italian is not so good as yours, and I was anxious to
practice it with the major domo, that’s all. We are all
moved by selfish motives, Miss Marlowe.”</p>

<p>“Not all,” said Doris. “Not Mr. Percy Levant.”</p>

<p>He started slightly, and fixed his brilliant eyes on her
for a second; then, with a laugh, said:</p>

<p>“Yes, even Mr. Percy Levant.”</p>

<p>Twenty times a day she found him coming to her assistance,
but always in the same way, always with the
same unobtrusiveness, which was almost coldness, but
which was very welcome to Doris, contrasted with the
fervent, accentuated attention of the rest of the men.</p>

<p>This evening, as she sat beside the hammock, looking
at the stars, which were beginning to peep out from the
midst of the deep blue of the sky, and thinking of the
past, she was conscious, in a half-troubled way, of recalling
one of the innumerable services Percy Levant
had rendered her, and she started when Lady Despard
said, in her sleepy fashion:</p>

<p>“I wonder where Mr. Levant is? Has he gone to the
hotel? I haven’t seen him all the evening. How one
misses him, doesn’t one?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Doris. “That is our tribute to his amiability.”</p>

<p>Lady Despard laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“He is quite the bright particular star of our group,”
she said. “Some of our fair Florentine friends are almost
mad about him. I shouldn’t wonder if he were
caught and chained before we leave.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Doris.</p>

<p>Lady Despard leaned over the hammock and regarded
her with a lazy smile.</p>

<p>“What a cold little ‘yes,’” she said. “I really believe
you are the only woman here who doesn’t admire him.”</p>

<p>“But I do admire him,” said Doris, smiling in return.
“I think he is the handsomest man I ever saw——” She
stopped and picked up the book, for unnoticed by Lady
Despard he had come up and stood beside the hammock.</p>

<p>“May one inquire the subject of Miss Marlowe’s encomium?”
he asked, and he looked from one to the other
with his usual smile, but Doris, glancing up at him, saw,
or fancied she saw, the shadow of the darkness which
she, and she alone, had discovered his face could wear.</p>

<p>“Oh, no one you know,” said Lady Despard. “May
one ask where you have been all this long while?”</p>

<p>“All this long while! A few hours! What a testimony
to one’s worth!” he said, as lightly as before, but
his eyes, as they rested on Doris’ pensive face, were
grave and intent. “I have been wandering in the
woods, listening to the birds.”</p>

<p>“While we have been dying to listen to you,” said
Lady Despard, with mock reproach. “We have missed
you terribly, haven’t we, Doris?”</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe is halting between truth and politeness,”
he said, as Doris remained silent. “I will spare
her a reply.”</p>

<p>“We’ve had no music to speak of,” said Lady Despard.
“Won’t you sing us something now? Shall we
go into the house?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said, almost abruptly. “Who would exchange
this”—and he waved his hand—“for four walls?
What shall I sing to you? Let me think.”</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, then he began to sing.</p>

<p>Doris never heard his voice, even in the crowded saloon,
without feeling a thrill run through her, but to-night,
although he sang in so low a tone that it seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
scarcely more than a whisper, the melody stirred her to
her depths, and brought the tears to her eyes.</p>

<p>“That is beautiful,” said Lady Despard, with a little
sigh. “We won’t spoil it by asking for another. Come,
Doris, dear. Will you come in, Mr. Levant?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” he said, slowly. “I’ll say good-night
now.”</p>

<p>He did not offer to shake hands, and the two ladies
left him and went toward the house. As they were ascending
the steps, Lady Despard stopped, and uttered
an exclamation:</p>

<p>“Oh, my bracelet!”</p>

<p>“What is it? Have you lost it?” inquired Doris.</p>

<p>“Yes; I must have dropped it while I was in the hammock!
I’ll go back——”</p>

<p>“No; I’ll go!” said Doris, and she ran back.</p>

<p>She had almost reached the spot where they had been
sitting, when, with a start, she saw in the starlight, a
man lying full length on the grass, with his face hidden
on his arm. It was Percy Levant. He sprang up at
the sound of her footsteps, and confronted her, and
Doris saw that his face was pale and haggard, so different,
indeed, to its usual bright and careless expression,
that she felt a shock of distress and almost fear.</p>

<p>“Mr. Levant!” she said, falteringly; then she recovered
herself. “I have come back for Lady Despard’s
bracelet,” stooping down and looking about her, to give
him time.</p>

<p>“It is here,” he said, picking it up.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” she said. “Good-night!”</p>

<p>“Wait! Will you wait a moment?” he asked, and his
voice, usually so soft and musical, sounded hoarse and
strained.</p>

<p>Doris stood, silent and downcast, and waited for him
to go on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">NOT LOVE, BUT PITY.</p>


<p>Doris’ own face grew a little paler as she looked at
him, so haggard was his; and yet his pallor lent an added
charm to his delicately-cut features and expressive, deeply-colored
eyes bent upon her with a strange, intent look, as
she sat on the edge of the hammock, and half trembling,
for she knew not what reason, waited for him to speak.
She was startled by the changed appearance of the man,
who was usually self-possession itself. He stood for a moment
in silence, leaning against one of the trees to which
the hammock was slung, his arms folded, his head sunk
on his breast, and a nightingale in a neighboring tree commenced
to sing; all her life afterward Doris never heard
a nightingale without recalling this night.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe,” he said, at last, and he spoke in a
voice so low that it seemed to harmonize with the voice of
the bird. “If I were wise I should let you go, even
now! But—I cannot, I cannot! Chance is too strong
for me. It sent you back to find me—as you found me,
and I must speak to you, and perhaps for the last time. I
am leaving the villa—Italy. I go to England to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Doris glanced up at him; a streak of light from one of
the brilliant windows fell across his handsome face, and
she saw that, with all his self-command, his lips trembled.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she murmured, and a faint thrill of regret
stirred her. She knew that he had been her friend, that
with all his apparent coldness and reserve he had never
lost an opportunity of quietly serving her. “I am afraid
you have heard bad news.”</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “I have heard no bad news, for the
best of reasons; there is no one to send me news of any
kind, bad or good. I am a man without a friend in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no!” she said, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>“I am not forgetting you, nor Lady Despard,” he said.
“But you—but Lady Despard, for whose kindness I am,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
and shall ever be, grateful—will she remember me after
one week’s absence, excepting as that of the man whose
voice helped to while away an idle half-hour, and amuse
her friends? And why should she?” he added, not bitterly,
but with a grave sadness that touched Doris deeply.
“I am, as I have always been, alone in the world—a man
of no account, a speck of dust dancing in the sunbeam
one moment, the next, floating in the gutter. Don’t think
I say this to excite your pity. No! It is because I want
you to remember what I am, how worthless and insignificant—just
Percy Levant, ‘the man who sings for Lady
Despard!’”</p>

<p>He smiled with a bitter self-scorn which lent to his face
an air of tragedy that fascinated Doris.</p>

<p>“And now you wonder, seeing that I am basking in the
sunshine just at present, that I should wish to leave it, and
sink into the mire again. I don’t wish it. If I could I
would remain at the Villa Rimini, to play the part of
Lady Despard’s singing man, till she grew weary, or the
voice which renders me acceptable lost its novelty and
became valueless. But I cannot stay. A power stronger
than my will is driving me, and if you had not come back
to seek for her ladyship’s bracelet, I should have gone
without a word of farewell to you, who are the cause of
my flight.”</p>

<p>Doris started and looked up at him.</p>

<p>“I?” she said, her brows drawn together with startled
trouble.</p>

<p>“Yes, you, Miss Marlowe,” he said, quietly, but with
something in the music of his voice that thrilled Doris.
“You will listen while I try and tell you? Heaven knows,
I find it hard enough. Be patient with me—oh, be patient
with me!” He held out his hand with a sudden gesture
of entreaty, then let it fall to his side. “How poor, how
friendless, how completely alone I am, you know; but I
am base enough to be proud as well, and all my life I have
been prouder of nothing more than my power to repay
the world’s scorn of my poverty and abjectness with my
scorn for the world. I prided myself on the fact that I
had no heart. For other men there might be happiness,
a life shared with some one whom they loved, and who
loved them in return; for me, the social outcast, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
pariah, there could be no such thing as love, no hope that
any woman could be found to share my poverty and my
hopelessness. So I went through the world, hardening
my heart, and telling myself that at least I should be
spared the madness which men call love.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and looked at her downcast face,
then went on:</p>

<p>“This was before I went to Chester Gardens. You
don’t remember that night, I dare say; I shall never forget
it, for it was the night upon which I first saw you—first
learned that all my pride was to melt at the sight of a
woman’s face, at the sound of a woman’s voice. Miss
Marlowe, if I had been a wise man, I would have taken
my hat and gone out of your presence never to return; but
the spell was wrought, and I consented to come here in
the train of Lady Despard, as her jester—her singing
man. I would have come in the capacity of her footman
or bootboy, if there had been no other place for me,
no other way of being near you——”</p>

<p>Doris looked up with a pale, startled face, and made
a movement to depart, but he stretched out his hand again
pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Ah! wait! Let me finish. I fought hard against the
influence which had fallen on me—fought day by day,
with all my strength; but against the spell you had, all unconsciously,
woven around me, fighting was of as little
avail as it would be to try and stem the incoming tide.
The iron had entered my soul, and I knew all at once that
my heart and life were bound up in one sentiment, my intense
love for you!”</p>

<p>Doris rose tremblingly.</p>

<p>“I have said it now,” he continued. “My secret is out.
I love you, Miss Marlowe—I, Lady Despard’s camp follower,
the jester of the Villa Rimini, have dared to love
its brightest ornament!”</p>

<p>And he laughed with mingled sadness and bitterness.</p>

<p>“I was mad, was I not? I ought to have selected her
lady’s maid—any one of the maids about the place. But
Miss Marlowe! The beautiful creature for whose smile
lords and princes, men of fame and note, were willing to
contend! Mad! Yes! But all love is madness, so they
say, and—well, that is my only excuse. And now, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
you send me away with one of those gentle smiles of
yours, let me tell you what I have to offer you. Myself—and
nothing! I have nothing but my voice to depend
upon. I lay it at your feet, knowing well that at a word
from you other men would lay their coronets and their
gold there.” He laughed again. “Not much to offer,
Miss Marlowe; but it is my all, and my life goes with it!
And yet, if you stooped to take it—well”—he drew a
long breath and his magnificent eyes seemed to glow—“well,
I think I could make a good fight of it!
The world should hear of Percy Levant, and you should
not be ashamed of the man whose hand you had stooped
to take. Yes!”—he bent forward with outstretched
hands. “With your love to encourage me, with you by
my side to make the struggle worth while, I would win
a name which at least might be not unworthy of you!
Ah, think a moment!” he pleaded, his voice suddenly quivering
in its intensity. “Think what your answer means
to me! To any of these others it might matter a good
deal, I grant, whether you said them ‘yes’ or ‘no;’ but they
have so many other things to live for—rank, wealth, place
in the world! But I! I have nothing but this wild mad
love of mine, this deep love for you which seems part and
parcel of my very being! Miss Marlowe—Doris—it is
a beggar who pleads to you for the one chance which will
lift him from a life which has never yet known happiness
to one of hope and perfect joy! Think and—ah, I love
you! I love you! Don’t send me away!” and he was on
his knees beside her, his face upturned to hers with an
expression which a man might wear who is indeed pleading
for his life.</p>

<p>Doris looked down at him speechlessly. His passionate
avowal, the wonderful music of every word, the handsome
face and thrilling eyes affected her strangely; but
she was more moved by the confession of his lowliness
and loneliness than by aught else. She, too, was she
not lowly enough and lonely enough, also? This, at least,
made a bond between them.</p>

<p>She did not love him, but—she pitied him; and pity,
with such a girl as Doris, is indeed, near akin to love.</p>

<p>What should she say to him? The thought of having
to tell him that there was no hope for him smote her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
with a keen sense of pain! She dreaded seeing his face
as she dealt the blow. She herself had loved, you see, and
could sympathize with him. Heaven! how hard it was
that she should have to rob the friendless, solitary man
of his one chance of happiness! She faltered and hesitated;
and a light of hope—wild, almost maddening hope—burned
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Doris!” he breathed; “Doris!”</p>

<p>“Hush! hush!” she said. “Ah! why have you told me
this? Why didn’t you go without telling me?”</p>

<p>“Forgive me!” he answered. “I was going. If you
had not come back in the moment of my struggle, you
would not have seen me again! And now I have told
you! You hesitate!”</p>

<p>“I hesitate because——” she paused, and looked down
at him with sweet, troubled gravity and tenderness, the
tenderness of a woman who is about to deal a man who
loves her the deadliest blow he can receive at her hands.
“Because I cannot love you. I”—her voice broke, but
she struggled with it and went on—“I care nothing for
rank or wealth; they are nothing to me. I should say
what I have said if you were a prince. I shall never
marry any one, Mr. Levant!” She turned her head aside,
but he saw the tears fill her eyes. “I am sorry, sorry,
sorry!” she murmured. “There is no one I like better.
I did not know, I never guessed that you wished—that
you wished me to be your wife; but I knew that you were
my friend, and I was proud that it should be so.”</p>

<p>“Your friend!” he breathed. “Only friend! Ah,
Doris! many and many a night I have wandered here,
watching the light in your window, and wondering
whether by some miracle I should win you! Your friend!
Well, I played my part well—I hid my heart’s secret while
it was possible.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, gently. “I never guessed it! And
now we must part—I must lose my friend! But I am
grateful—ah, so grateful. You speak as if I were so far
above you! You forget that I also am alone, and lowlier
than yourself, for I am a woman, while you are a man,
with all the world before you.”</p>

<p>“No,” he said; “all the world lies behind me. Losing
you I say good-by to any hope of happiness; good-by to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
ambition! Percy Levant and the world have done with
each other from to-night!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! no!” she murmured, pleadingly. “You do
not know! If I told you that I am not worthy of your
love; that I am not only poor and friendless, but”—her
face went paler, and her lips quivered—“but nameless!
That my life has been wrecked——”</p>

<p>“Wait! wait!” he said, with a strange expression on his
face, his voice suddenly hoarse. “Tell me nothing! I
know—I know as surely as that these stars are above
us, that not an ignoble thought, not one unworthy deed,
has ever stained your life. What sorrows have come to
you have been undeserved. Nothing could shake my
faith in you, my queen, for you are my heart’s queen.
Ah, Doris, give yourself to me from to-night! Let me
make a fresh life for you; let me teach you to forget the
past; let me make the future for you! Say yes, for my
sake—or your own! Yes, for your own! See how confident
I am that I can make you forget—make you happy!
It is my love gives me confidence. I ask for so little—I
don’t ask you to love me! I ask you to confide yourself
and your future to me. I know that I shall win your love—I
am not afraid.” His face lit up as if transfigured by
the hope that had sprung up within his breast. “With
you by my side I can face the world, and vanquish it!
Doris! Doris!”</p>

<p>She put her hand to her eyes, and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>“And you will be content?” she murmured, almost inaudibly.
“Content to accept so little for all you offer me—for
so much love?”</p>

<p>“Content? Yes!” he responded, fervently, with a world
of meaning in his voice. “Yes, I shall be content! I can
guess, though you shall tell me nothing now, dearest, that
there has been some one else, some other man, who proved
unworthy the great treasure of your love, that you have
not forgotten him, and the sorrow he caused you! I ask
nothing! I am content to wait, and win back your heart
for myself, and I shall win it! Now, my queen, give me
my sentence,” and he held his hand out to her.</p>

<p>Half-dazed by his passionate pleading, touched by the
generosity of his faith and belief in her, thinking of him
and not of herself, Doris slowly let her hand fall into his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>He did not take her in his arms, but his hand closed on
hers and held it in a close grasp, then, as he pressed his
lips to it, he murmured: “My queen! my queen!” with a
passionate reverence that would have moved a harder
heart than Doris’.</p>

<p>She drew her hand from his clasp gently, and he did not
offer to retain it, as if he meant to show her that his
promise to be content to wait until he had won her love
was something more than an empty phrase.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” he murmured. “Good-night, Doris!
Some day you will know how happy you have made me!
Some day when I have taught you to know what happiness
means! Good-night, my love, my queen!”</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment through a mist of tears—tears
that fell upon the grave of her old love—and then
glided from his side.</p>

<p>He stood, where she had left him, watching her till the
glimmer of her white dress faded from his sight; then he
threw himself on the ground and covered his eyes with his
hands.</p>

<p>“Great Heaven!” he murmured, “am I mad or dreaming?
Is she mine, mine, mine? Oh, my darling, my
beautiful! I will keep my word! You shall be happy!
I swear it! I swear——” he raised his hand to the silent,
star-gemmed sky, then stopped and stared with a sudden
horror, for there in front of him stood Mr. Spenser
Churchill. He stood with his pale, smooth face smiling
unctuously down upon him, a half-mocking smile curving
the sleek lips.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear Percy!” he murmured, smoothly. “How
do you do? How do you do? Surprised to see me.
Yes. You look rather startled. Almost as if you had
forgotten me!”</p>

<p>Percy Levant rose to his feet, his eyes still fixed on
the smiling face.</p>

<p>“By Heaven;” he breathed, almost with a groan. “I
had forgotten you!”</p>

<p>“Really? Now wasn’t that a little ungrateful, eh?
To forget your best friend—one who has always had
your best and truest interests at heart! Tut, tut, my dear
Percy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“When—when did you come?” demanded the other, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>“Almost this moment. I have just looked in at the
villa, and greeted our fair hostess. Hearing that my
dear young friend, Miss Marlowe, was in the garden, I
asked permission to come in search of her, and—er—found
her so deeply engaged that I did not venture to intrude
myself.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant looked from one side to the other.</p>

<p>“You—you have been listening?” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill looked very much shocked.</p>

<p>“My dear Percy, what a dreadful charge! Listening?
Certainly not! Seeing you—er—immersed in each other’s
conversation, I took a little stroll, and waited until the
interview had come to a close.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant leaned against the tree with his arms
folded, his head bent upon his breast, but his eyes still
fixed upon the other man’s. His face was pale, and there
were great drops of sweat upon his brow.</p>

<p>“And how goes our little arrangement, my dear
Percy? Am I to congratulate you? Though I didn’t
listen, as you so cruelly suggested, I gathered that your
suit was meeting with a favorable reception. Did my
judgment play me false, or has Miss Marlowe accepted
you?”</p>

<p>The younger man remained silent for a moment; then
he said, almost inaudibly:</p>

<p>“She—accepted me.”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill nodded with a smile of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Capital! I congratulate you, my dear Percy. I congrat——”</p>

<p>The smooth, oily voice broke off suddenly, for Percy
Levant had seized the speaker by the shoulder, and held
him in a grasp of steel.</p>

<p>“Silence!” he groaned out between his teeth. “What
devil prompted you to come here to-night?—Heaven!—to-night!”</p>

<p>“My dear Percy, I came to see how you were progressing;
not that I was anxious! Oh, dear, no! I knew
that that handsome face and lovely voice of yours would
prove irresistible; but I wanted to see for myself how our
little scheme was going on——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“And I had forgotten you!” dropped from Percy Levant’s
lips. “Yes, I swear it! I remembered nothing but
that I loved her——”</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill’s lips wreathed in a rather painful
smile, for the grasp of the strong hand made him
shudder.</p>

<p>“You—you fiend, you cannot believe it, cannot understand!
How should such as you believe that I had forgotten
our devilish contract, that I should love her for
herself alone——” He broke off and his head dropped.</p>

<p>“Come, come, my dear Percy, the delicate sentiment you
have expressed does you credit. Of course you love Miss
Marlowe for herself, and the fact that you happen to
know that she is not so poor as she thinks herself—in fact,
that in marrying her you make a rich man of yourself—goes
for nothing. Of course, of course! Very nice and—er—proper.
But—would you mind taking your hand
from my shoulder; you have remarkably strong fingers,
my dear Percy! But I trust you will not forget that I
have a curious document in my possession——”</p>

<p>Percy Levant withdrew his hand with a sudden and
violent thrust that caused the philanthropist to spin round
like a teetotum.</p>

<p>“Remember? Yes, I remember!” he said, hoarsely.
“It would be as well for you if I had continued to forget
it! Keep out of my sight while you are here, or I will
not answer for myself!”</p>

<p class="center">THE GLASS OF FASHION.</p>


<p>Doris went back to the house scarcely knowing whether
she was awake or dreaming. Could it be possible that
she had promised to be Percy Levant’s wife? She stood
for a moment outside the door of Lady Despard’s <i>boudoir</i>,
trying to realize all that had passed, and the step she had
taken so strangely, so suddenly, and when Lady Despard
called out, “Is that you, Doris?” she started like one
awakening from sleep.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is I,” she said. “There is your bracelet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, dear. I am afraid you have had a
hard search! Why—what is the matter?” she broke off
to exclaim as Doris turned her face to the light. “Why,
dear, you are as white as a ghost, and your hands”—taking
them anxiously—“are burning. Doris, you have
taken a chill! You foolish child, to stay out so long, and
on account of this stupid bracelet. Why, it isn’t of the
slightest consequence! Go to bed at once, dear. Stay,
I’ll come up with you. You look dreadfully ill!”</p>

<p>“I am not ill,” said Doris, and she sank down on the
leopard skin at Lady Despard’s feet. “I have something
to tell you, Lady Despard. It was not your bracelet that
kept me so long; I—I have been talking to Mr. Levant.”</p>

<p>“To Percy Levant! He was there still? What could
he have to say? Ah! You don’t mean to tell me, Doris,
that he has proposed to you?” exclaimed her ladyship, in
a tone of suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Doris, in a low voice; “he has asked me
to be his wife.”</p>

<p>“And—and you said ‘No,’ of course?”</p>

<p>“I said ‘Yes,’” replied Doris.</p>

<p>Her ladyship sank back, and stared at the pale, lovely
face.</p>

<p>“You—said—‘yes’! But, good heavens, my dear
Doris, have you thought? Percy Levant! Why, child,
there are half-a-dozen of the best of the men here madly
in love with you. I know—I know—that the Prince
Romanis is only waiting an opportunity to propose to
you! He hinted as much to me yesterday! And Percy
Levant! Of course, I’m not surprised that he should ask
you; I’ve seen that he was over head in love with you.
Of course, we’ve all seen it, but never thought he would
venture to tell you, least of all that he should ask you to
be his wife. Why—why, he hasn’t a penny; he is as
poor as a churchmouse.”</p>

<p>“Then he is as rich as I,” said Doris, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes; but—but——! But, there, what is the use of
talking; it’s his face and his voice, of course. And how
long have you cared for him? Are you sure you love
him?”</p>

<p>Doris’ face grew scarlet for a moment, then went pale
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“He loves me very dearly and truly,” she murmured,
almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>“Yes! That’s nothing wonderful; so do other men.
But you, you—do you love him?”</p>

<p>“I shall marry him,” said Doris, gently.</p>

<p>Lady Despard almost groaned.</p>

<p>“Why, child, you must have taken leave of your senses.
You have consented to marry a poor man, a man of whom
one knows nothing, and you haven’t even the excuse that
you love him!”</p>

<p>Doris leaned her head upon her hand so that her face
was hidden from Lady Despard’s anxiously searching
eyes.</p>

<p>“I respect him; I think him worthy——”</p>

<p>Lady Despard broke in impatiently:</p>

<p>“My dear, dear child, how can you tell? What experience
have you had?”</p>

<p>Doris looked up with a swift spasm of pain.</p>

<p>“I have had some experience,” she said, in a low,
troubled voice. “You ask me if I love him. He knows
that I do not, and he is content. Lady Despard, I have
had two great sorrows in my life—the loss of him who
stood as a father to me was one; the other was the discovery
that the man to whom I had given my heart——”
She stopped. “Is it so easy to love, and lose, and forget,
and love again so quickly?”</p>

<p>Lady Despard laid her hand upon her head with tender
sympathy.</p>

<p>“My poor Doris!” she said, gently and pityingly. “And
that is why you are so cold to them all? I might have
known there was something. I am so sorry, dear! But—but
why consent to marry Percy Levant?”</p>

<p>Doris smiled wearily.</p>

<p>“I—don’t be angry with me—I don’t think I can answer
in set terms. Perhaps it is because I think I can make
him happy; perhaps it is because he is as lonely as I am,
or should be but for you, dear Lady Despard. Why
should I not marry him and make his life happier and
brighter? Perhaps”—her lips quivered—“I shall learn
to forget the past now that I have buried it forever!”</p>

<p>Lady Despard looked at her with troubled apprehension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“My dear——” she commenced, but Doris stopped her
almost excitedly.</p>

<p>“If you are going to tell me that that is hopeless, that
I shall never forget, don’t go on,” she said, in a low, hurried
voice. “Right or wrong, I have given my word, and—and
for the future it is of him I shall think and not of
myself. I am a woman—and shall not break my promise,”
she added, almost to herself, and with a touch of bitterness
as she thought of the man who had broken his promise
to her. “Dear Lady Despard, I have told you because
I thought it right you should know, because,” with a little
wince, “I will never again conceal anything—anything
that should be told. And now you will accept it as something
fixed and irrevocable, will you not? And you will
wish me happiness?” she added, looking up at her with a
smile shining through a veil of tears.</p>

<p>Lady Despard stooped and put her arm round the slender
neck and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Wish you happiness? With all my heart, dear!” she
said, warmly. “And now you must forgive all I have
said. I was a little surprised and—yes, just a little disappointed.
I was thinking of the poor prince, you must
remember. But, after all, you have chosen the handsomest
and nicest man of them all; and I’m sure all the
women will be fit to die with envy.” Doris smiled at this
characteristic touch. “And as to his being poor—why,
we will see about that, my dear. They tell me I’ve no end
of influence, and it will be a very hard case if we can’t
find some nice place for him. Oh, you needn’t blush,
dear; I know he is proud, and you, too, but it’s the duty
of practical folks like me to look after such romantic
young couples as you! Oh, you will see! And now I’ve
got a surprise for you: Who do you think has come?”</p>

<p>Doris shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’m equal to the feeblest kind of conundrum
to-night,” she said.</p>

<p>“I dare say not. Well, Mr. Spenser Churchill—your
guardian, as I call him—is here.”</p>

<p>Doris started.</p>

<p>“He!” she said, in a low voice, as the old feeling of
mingled fear and repugnance rose within her.</p>

<p>“Yes! I was as surprised as you are, for he had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
written, as you know. He is out in the grounds looking
for you——”</p>

<p>Doris rose almost hastily.</p>

<p>“I—I think I will go to bed,” she said. “I am very
tired, and you will excuse me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ll excuse you,” said Lady Despard, smiling.
“It is only natural that you should want to run away and
hide yourself to-night. And, am I to tell him, dear?”</p>

<p>Doris turned at the door.</p>

<p>“You may tell every one,” she said, quietly. “All the
world may know it. It is quite fixed and certain, Lady
Despard.”</p>

<p>Doris lay awake all through that night trying to realize
the fact that she was betrothed to Percy Levant, and by
the morning she had succeeded. She would begin a new
chapter of her life from this date. The past, which was
illuminated by the memory of those happy days in Barton
meadows, when she loved and thought herself beloved by
Lord Cecil Neville, must be buried forever. In the future
she must set her heart upon one task, that of learning to
love the man who loved her so truly and devotedly, and
whom she had promised to marry.</p>

<p>She went down to breakfast a little paler than usual,
but very calm and self-possessed, looking, as Lady Despard
thought, as she greeted her with a loving kiss, like a
lily, in her simple white frock.</p>

<p>“Well, dear!” she said, “you have come down, then! I
told Mr. Churchill that you were so tired last night that
you would very likely not put in an appearance till lunch.
He’s on the terrace—oh! here he is!”</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill came in at the French window
as she spoke, and advanced to Doris with his sweetest and
most benevolent smile.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Marlowe!” he murmured. “How do
you do? I am so glad to see you, and looking the picture
of health and happiness”—there were dark marks under
Doris’ eyes, which wore the look a sleepless night always
produces—“the very picture of health and happiness!
And with good reason—good reason! You see, a little
bird has told me the news,” and he wagged his head
playfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“Am I very much like a little bird?” said Lady Despard.
“I told him, Doris, dear; you said I might.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear Lady Despard has told me!” he said, spreading
his napkin over his knee and smiling upon them both.
“And I hasten to express my best and most heartfelt
wishes. Lucky Percy! I must confess that I envy him!
He is such a dear fellow! I have known him since he
was, oh, quite a boy, and he was always, oh, quite too
charming! But I never dreamed he would be so fortunate
as to win so great a prize as the beautiful Miss
Doris!”</p>

<p>Doris took her place in silence. Lady Despard laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s a very nice speech and hits them both,” she
said.</p>

<p>“And it is such a strange coincidence,” he went on.
“They say that good luck always comes in showers! Do
you know I am the bearer of a very good offer for our
dear Percy? I won’t give you the particulars, but will
only say that it will make him almost a rich man. Really,
the dear fellow is in favor with the gods.”</p>

<p>The door opened and Percy Levant walked in. He
bowed to Lady Despard, and to Spenser Churchill, then
went to Doris, took her hand and raised it to his lips, and,
as a matter of course, seated himself next to her.</p>

<p>He held a couple of small bouquets in his hand, and,
placing one beside Lady Despard’s plate, laid the other
against Doris’.</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks,” said Lady Despard, talking quickly to
cover the little embarrassment. “You have been flower-gathering
this morning? And you met Mr. Spenser
Churchill last night? I am so glad he has come, for I
want to hear all the news—all the London news, I mean!
We seem to be quite at the other end of the world here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill shrugged his shoulders
amusedly.</p>

<p>“One comes here to learn the news,” he said, with a
significant smile at Doris and Percy Levant.</p>

<p>Doris’ face flushed, but Percy Levant’s remained
grave.</p>

<p>“As Mr. Churchill has no gossip to relate, perhaps this
will be acceptable,” he said. “I have just got it by this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
post,” and he took a society journal from his pocket and
handed it to Doris to pass to Lady Despard.</p>

<p>“<i>The Glass of Fashion!</i>” exclaimed her ladyship.
“How nice! I haven’t seen it for ages,” and she opened
it with a little flush of satisfaction. “I always enjoy <i>The
Glass</i>; it is always so charmingly spiteful. It ought to be
called <i>The Cup of Poison</i>, for it destroys a reputation
every week.”</p>

<p>She began turning over the pages of this, the latest
product in society journalism, and Spenser Churchill in
vain endeavored to engage Percy Levant in conversation,
then suddenly Lady Despard uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, dear Lady Despard?” asked
Spenser Churchill. “Has <i>The Glass</i> attacked one of your
bosom friends?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; it’s this!” replied Lady Despard. “Just
listen:</p>

<p>“‘Rumor, which is not always untruthful, hinted some
time ago at the engagement of one of our principal
beauties to the heir of the oldest marquisate in England;
and we are now authorized to formally announce that
Lady Grace Peyton is engaged to Lord Cecil Neville, the
heir and nephew of the Marquis of Stoyle. The marriage
will take place as soon as the marquis has recovered from
his present attack of illness.’</p>

<p>“Cecil Neville and Grace Peyton are really engaged,
then, and to be married out of hand! Well—oh, look!—Doris!”
she broke off, with a cry of dismay, for Doris had
fallen back in a dead faint.</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill, with a cry of alarm, sprang
from his chair and hastened round the table; but Percy
Levant had raised her in his arms, and, as he supported
her lifeless form on his breast, stretched out one hand to
ward Spenser Churchill off.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” he said, hoarsely, his white face set hard
and stern. “You shall not touch her!” and, lifting her
bodily, he carried her into the hall.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">ENGAGED.</p>


<p>On this occasion, at least, the society papers did not
lie! Lord Cecil Neville and Lady Grace Peyton were
engaged! If some marriages are made in Heaven, certainly
some other matches are made by the gossip-mongers,
and this was one of them.</p>

<p>If any one had told Cecil Neville that in a few short
months he would, though having lost Doris, have proposed
to Lady Grace, he would have laughed the prophet
to scorn; and yet propose to her he did.</p>

<p>From that eventful morning when he had received, as
he thought, irrefutable proof of Doris’ faithlessness and
treachery, and been rescued from imprisonment by Lady
Grace, a great change had fallen upon Cecil Neville. Life
had lost its savor, and the days that used to pass so
swiftly, with pleasure at the helm and youth at the prow,
hung like lead upon his hands. Time, which most of us
find all too short, dragged terribly with him. Do what
he would, he could not drown the memory of the beautiful
girl whom he had loved so passionately, and whose
image seemed engraven upon his heart. Morning, noon,
and night her presence seemed to haunt him. He went
about as usual for a day or two, but the old amusements;
the clubs, where he was always so warmly greeted; the
dances, which never seemed complete successes without
“Cissy” Neville; the river parties, and four-in-hand excursions,
in which he was always the leading spirit, all
seemed tame and spiritless, and though he laughed as
usual, and tried to hide the wound which he had received,
his friends noticed that he seemed preoccupied and
gloomy; and when he found that they observed it, and
that he was sitting silent in the midst of the carnival of
pleasure, like the ghost-haunted man in the ballad, he
suddenly took his fishing-rod and went off to Norway.</p>

<p>He had met Lady Grace frequently since the morning
she had come to his rescue, but they had only exchanged
a few words at meeting and parting, as he felt that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
could not talk as if nothing had happened, and he would
not talk of what had happened, and on the night before
his sudden departure he had only said a few concise
words of farewell.</p>

<p>“Going to Norway?” she said, in a constrained voice.
“Yes?—well, I think that is the best thing you can do;
it is all very stupid here in London!” and she had given
him her hand, and let her magnificent eyes rest on his
for a second or two with a look that would have impressed
him and set him thinking, if he had ever given
thought to any other subject but the faithless girl who
had jilted him.</p>

<p>If any one had told him that Lady Grace had gone
home a few minutes after parting from him, and shut
herself up for a couple of days, reappearing, looking pale
and weary, it would never have occurred to him that her
sudden disappearance had been on his account.</p>

<p>He went to Norway, and though he thought of her
now and again with a gratitude which made him miserable—for
he could not see how on earth he was going
to repay her the money she had so generously paid for
him—he was too much occupied with recalling Doris to
think much of this other beautiful woman. He ought
to have been happy in Norway, for the fishing was
good, and he was lucky, but the big salmon did not
bring him the satisfaction they used to do; and he was
sitting one evening in the room of the rather rough inn
at which he was staying, wondering what he should
do with himself next, and whether it wouldn’t be better
to go and bury himself in South Africa, or volunteer for
the next of our little wars, when he heard his name mentioned.
There was a party of young men staying at the
inn, and they occupied the room next to his and divided
from it by the thinnest of partitions, through which their
constant chatter and laughter filtered day and night to
worry him.</p>

<p>When he heard his name, he woke up from a reverie in
which he was wondering whether Doris was happy, and
whether she ever thought of him and those days in the
Barton meadows; and, remembering that listeners seldom
hear any good of themselves, he took up his pipe, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
was walking out to smoke in the open air, when it
seemed to him that he heard Lady Grace’s name also.</p>

<p>Thinking that the speakers might be friends of his
and hers, he waited a moment, then sunk back into his
chair, his face scarlet, his brow dark with a heavy frown—for
this is what he heard:</p>

<p>“I tell you, it’s an absolute truth,” said one of the
young fellows. “I had it from a most reliable source.
The lady in question was seen leaving Lord Cecil Neville’s
rooms alone and unattended——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Lady Grace—Lady Grace, of all women
in the world!—go alone to Lord Neville’s chambers!
You must be mad, old fellow!”</p>

<p>“I’m not mad!” retorted the first speaker, “and I
wish to goodness you wouldn’t bellow out her name; I
carefully avoided mentioning it; these walls are no
thicker than paper, and you can’t tell who may be on
the other side.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” said the other; “but, come, you
know, the story is as thin as the partition! Why, no
woman would do such a thing, unless she were utterly
reckless of her good name.”</p>

<p>“I daresay not,” said the first, still as coolly; “but perhaps
the lady in question happens to be reckless where
this gentleman is concerned. Anyhow, I had it on good
authority, and I happen to know it is an undisputable
fact. Why, man, it was all the talk when I left London.
It is said that she is head over ears in love with him——”</p>

<p>“Phew!” exclaimed one of the others, “that makes it
worse. If she was guilty of such an indiscretion, all I
can say is she must be very much in love! Lady
Grace——”</p>

<p>“Do shut up!” cried the first speaker. “No names, remember!”</p>

<p>“Well, well, the lady in question is one of the best
known women in society, and such a report would mean
social ruin to her. Where did you hear it? Give me
your authority.”</p>

<p>The first man seemed to pause a moment, then in a
voice too low for Cecil to hear, said:</p>

<p>“I don’t mind giving it to you; I heard it from Spenser
Churchill!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>“Then you may swear to its truth; that man never
makes a mistake!” responded one of the young fellows.
“Well, I’m awfully sorry. Lady—the lady is always very
kind and pleasant to me, and I think her one of the
loveliest creatures in the world. As for Lord Neville—well,
if he can remain quiescent while this story is going
about, and does nothing to contradict it or set it right—all
I can say, he is a very different man from what I
have always understood him to be. Where is he now?
I hear he has come a regular cropper in money matters.
I saw him a little while ago, and he looked awfully down
on his luck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s gone abroad, I believe,” replied the other.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil sat perfectly still for a minute, his brain
surging, his heart beating with mingled fury and consternation;
then, with his pipe still in his hand, he got
up and knocked at the door of the adjoining room.</p>

<p>Some one opened it, and Lord Cecil, with a slight bow,
stepped in and stood before the group of young men, who
stared at his now grave, pale face inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to disturb you, gentlemen,” he said; “but
it is only right I should tell you that I am the occupant
of the next room, and that I have heard every word
you said.”</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed the young fellow who had started
the conversation, in a tone of vexation and reproach; “I
told you so! I said the partition was like paper, and that
some one might be on the other side, and you fellows
wouldn’t believe me!”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have heard every word,” said Lord Neville,
sternly; “and as I have the honor to be a friend of the
lady of whom you were speaking, it is my duty to tell
you that the man who whispers a word against the reputation
of that lady is a liar!”</p>

<p>They sprang to their feet as a body, and stared at him
with angry surprise; but Lord Cecil put up his hand to
command silence.</p>

<p>“Hear me out, please. You may, not unnaturally,
demand to know why I should take upon myself to
champion this lady’s cause. I do so because I hope to
have the honor of being that lady’s husband. My name
is Cecil Neville; there is my card.” He did not toss it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
melodramatically, but courteously placed it on the table
before them. “If any of you consider that he is affronted
by what I have said, I shall be happy to afford him any
satisfaction he may think necessary.”</p>

<p>With a slight bow he was leaving the room, when the
young fellow who had been the first speaker, said:</p>

<p>“One moment, Lord Neville, if you please.” Lord
Cecil stopped, and stood facing them, with a stern countenance.
“If any one is to blame in this matter, it is
myself; and I am ready to give you any satisfaction you
may require; but I think it right to state, frankly and
freely, that I did not mention the lady’s name, nor was
I aware that she was engaged to you. I will say, also,
that I deeply regret that I should have mentioned the
subject at all. But I spoke the simple truth when I said
that it was a topic of common rumor; and I may add
that it will give me great pleasure and satisfaction to contradict
the report whenever and wherever I may hear it
repeated.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” said Lord Cecil, simply, and with a
grave bow that took in all of them, he turned and left the
room.</p>

<p>An hour later he was on his way to England.</p>

<p>By whomsoever spread, this report was in circulation—and
he could not contradict it! Lady Grace had been
to his rooms alone and unattended, and it was his duty
as a gentleman and a man of honor to protect her.</p>

<p>He had heard, with a scarlet face, the words of the
young fellow, who had said that Lady Grace was in love
with him, and though he did not believe it—for had she
not herself said that it was not so?—it was his duty to
propose to her.</p>

<p>What did it matter what became of him, or whom he
married? He must marry some one, and some day. The
heir to the marquisate of Stoyle could not remain single.
Rank has its duties as well as its privileges, and it is the
duty of the head of a noble house to carry on the direct
line. He would have to marry sooner or later, though
his heart throbbed and ached every time he thought of
Doris Marlowe; and why not marry Lady Grace?</p>

<p>He thought of her beauty; he recalled her noble generosity
to him. Why, she had not only come to his aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
when he was in mortal straits, but she had done so at
the risk of her social reputation! Surely, if he must
marry some one, it must be Lady Grace.</p>

<p>He might also have reminded himself that by so doing
he would win his uncle’s—the marquis’—favor; but, to do
Lord Cecil credit, he did not think of that; he only remembered
Lady Grace’s goodness to him.</p>

<p>He reached London at noon, had a bath, and allowed
his valet to clothe him in the regulation morning attire,
and went straight to the Peytons’ house.</p>

<p>The footman told him that Lady Grace was out, riding
in the park.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait,” said Lord Cecil, and he went into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>He paced up and down the Turkey carpet, looking
out of the window, and staring at the ornaments on the
mantel-shelf. Among them was one of the fashionable
cabinet photograph frames, with the portrait covered by
a curtain. In absence of mind he drew the curtain aside
and saw a portrait of himself.</p>

<p>With a sudden flush he let it fall, as the door opened,
and Lady Grace entered.</p>

<p>She was in her riding-habit—in the garb which set
off her perfectly graceful figure to its very best advantage.</p>

<p>As she entered, her mature and majestic loveliness
struck him fully for the first time, and he remembered
with a sudden vividness the words of one of the young
fellows at the Norwegian inn. Yes, she was one of the
loveliest of society women!</p>

<p>She started perceptibly at sight of him, so much so
that she dropped her whip. He sprang forward and
picked it up for her, and by the time he had given it
her—few moments though the action required—she had
recovered herself.</p>

<p>“Back so soon!” she said, giving him her hand, small,
and white, and warm. “This is a surprise! Don’t the
salmon bite, or rise, or whatever you call it? Or has it
rained all the time, and have you been bored to death?
I’m afraid you’ll be bored just as much in London, for
every one is leaving.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>“The salmon were all right,” he said, still holding her
hand. “I came back because I wanted to see you!”</p>

<p>“To see me?” she said, her eyes flashing into his for a
moment, and then drooping. “Well, you were just in
time, for papa and I were off to the Continent.”</p>

<p>“Then I have just come in time,” he said.</p>

<p>“Let me give you some tea; sit down,” she said, and
gently tried to withdraw her hand, but he held it firmly.</p>

<p>“Never mind the tea, Lady Grace,” he said, with something
of his old light-heartedness. “You shall give me—or
refuse me—a cup after you have heard what I have
to say.”</p>

<p>“And what have you to say that is more important
than tea?” she retorted, in a light tone, which was belied
by the quiver on her lips.</p>

<p>“I have come to ask you to be my wife,” he said,
quietly.</p>

<p>She put her left hand to her bosom, and her beautiful
eyes dilated. If joy always killed, then Lady Grace
would have fallen dead at Cecil Neville’s feet that moment;
but it is sorrow, not joy, that kills, and instead of
falling, she leaned towards him with a tremulous sigh.
It was almost too good to be believed! Spenser Churchill
had told her that it would come, but she had always
doubted it; and now—it had come! He was hers. Hers!—he,
whom she had grown to love—the man for whom
she had plotted and risked so much, even her social good
name—was hers!</p>

<p>It was a proud, an ecstatic moment; no wonder she
prolonged it.</p>

<p>“What do you say?” he asked, still holding her hand,
his grave voice as much unlike an ardent lover’s as it is
possible to imagine; and yet it was like music to her!
“I know I am not worthy to win so great a prize, but
I will do my best to make you happy.”</p>

<p>“And—and you love me?” she asked.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous question, but she was a woman,
and longed to hear the magic words which every woman
loves to hear from the lips of the man she loves.</p>

<p>He paused imperceptibly.</p>

<p>“Who could do anything but love you, dear Grace!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
he replied. “Will you be my wife? I will try and make
you happy, indeed I will! What do you say?”</p>

<p>Her soft, warm fingers closed on his, and she leaned
towards him involuntarily.</p>

<p>“If you are sure”—she murmured—“if you are sure
you want me to say ‘yes’——”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do!” he responded. “I have come all the
way from Norway in the hope that you would.”</p>

<p>“Then I will say—‘yes!’” she breathed, and her head
sank upon his breast. “You will be good to me—Cecil?”</p>

<p>“I will be good to you,” he responded, and he put his
arm round her and kissed her in lover-wise, but not—ah,
not!—with the passionate kisses which he had rained
upon the lips, and eyes, and hair of Doris Marlowe!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">WICKED LORD STOYLE.</p>


<p>The news spread, as such news will, and in a day or
two all London knew, through the gossip-mongers and
the society papers, that Lord Cecil Neville, the heir to
the marquisate of Stoyle, had proposed to Lady Grace.</p>

<p>“So that there was something in that story of her going
to his rooms, you see!” envious mothers whispered behind
their fans.</p>

<p>And the following morning Cecil Neville received a
short message from the marquis, who was staying at the
big house in Grosvenor Square, requesting that Cecil
would come and see him.</p>

<p>Cecil went, and found his lordship seated by the window
of his own room, looking at the passers-by as if he
were a judge just donning the black cap. His thin lips
drew together with a smile that was more like a sneer as
he gave Cecil a couple of cold fingers.</p>

<p>“So you’ve come to your senses at last?” was his amiable
greeting.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil smiled rather grimly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you allude to my engagement to Lady Grace,
sir?” he said. “I was coming to call on you when your
message reached me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>“Ah! Well, I congratulate you, and I wish her every
happiness,” remarked the marquis by way of a blessing,
and his tone said quite plainly: “But I don’t think she’ll
get it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you are a confoundedly lucky fellow,”
continued the marquis, “especially as you nearly got into
the worst mess a man can get into. I suppose that affair
turned out as I expected? The wench jilted you—oh, I
don’t want to know any particulars, they wouldn’t interest
me; but I may be permitted to express a hope that you
have completely washed your hands of the whole affair,
and that if the girl turns up again, there will be no nonsense.
Grace is far too good for you, and very much too
good for any trick of that kind.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil bit his lip and frowned.</p>

<p>“If I understand you, my lord——” Then he stopped.
“No, sir, we won’t quarrel to-day. As you say that—that
affair is over and done with, and if Miss Marlowe
were to come back, I promise that I will not, as you delicately
suggest, desert Lady Grace for her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I hinted,” said the marquis, coolly.
“I’m glad to hear there’s no danger of it. Men are such
fools—young ones especially—that one never knows.”</p>

<p>“I may be a fool, but I’m not a blackguard!” said Cecil,
almost beside himself.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” assented the marquis, deliberately, “and
now I suppose you mean to have the marriage quickly?”</p>

<p>“That rests entirely with Lady Grace,” said Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“Of course. I hate long engagements; besides, I’ve
an absurd fancy for seeing her married before I die. Not
that I think of dying just yet, you’ll be sorry to hear. Better
get the affair settled speedily. You can live in one of
the places in the country; I don’t care where it is, as long
as you don’t expect me to come and live with you,” and
he smiled sardonically.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil remained silent.</p>

<p>“You’d better take the Barton place. I hate it; but I
hate all of them, so that is not much of a reason.”</p>

<p>“Barton is too large, is it not, sir?” said Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“That’s my business,” retorted his lordship, with something
like a snarl. “I don’t mean you to be a pauper, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
to live with a couple of servants and on bread and cheese.
You have done as I wished you to do, though not until
you were compelled,” and he smiled, significantly, “and
I will do what is requisite in the way of money—for her
sake.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my lord—for her sake,” said Lord Cecil,
grimly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Why doesn’t she come and see me? Tell her
to do so, if you please.” He was silent a moment as Lord
Cecil bowed, then he added: “The affair is making some
stir, I suppose. I’m thinking whether I can summon up
courage to give a party—in honor of the event.”</p>

<p>“Pray, don’t take so much trouble, sir,” said Cecil.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I must,” continued the marquis, as if
Cecil had not spoken. “It is the usual thing, and she
will look for it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Lady Grace expects——”</p>

<p>“You know very little of what Lady Grace expects,” he
interrupted, with cold contempt. “Tell her to come to
me. Wait a moment, please,” he added, as Lord Cecil
was making his escape. “I am going to send her a present;
that is also due to her. I suppose you have been able
to afford her a thirty-shilling ring?”</p>

<p>“I gave rather more than that, sir,” replied Lord Cecil,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Ah! go to that safe, if you please, and bring me one
or two of the jewel cases. I will send her something
now. Here are the keys—no, they are in that drawer,”
and he pointed to the small writing cabinet which always
accompanied him, and handed Lord Cecil a small key.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil unlocked the cabinet, got the keys, and was
crossing the room to the safe, when the door opened.</p>

<p>“What the devil do you mean by coming in without
knocking, sir?” exclaimed the marquis; then, as he saw
who it was, he said, in a softer voice: “Oh, it’s you,
Spenser, is it? You’ve come in time to hear the news
and congratulate the bridegroom.”</p>

<p>“Which I do with all my heart, my dear Cecil,” murmured
Spenser Churchill, taking Lord Cecil’s hand in
both of his and pressing it affectionately, while he beamed
a benedictory smile all over him. “With all my heart!
I can’t tell you, my dear marquis, how rejoiced I was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
hear the news. Dear Lady Grace! So beautiful and so
good! You are, indeed, a happy man, Cecil! May every
good gift which Heaven has to bestow——”</p>

<p>“That will do,” broke in the marquis, with a sneer;
“we’ll take the rest as read, if you don’t mind. I’ve told
Cecil that I will give a party to mark my sense of his
sense.”</p>

<p>“A party? Excellent! admirable!” exclaimed Spenser
Churchill, rubbing his hands, his eyes going from the marquis’
cold, sardonic face to Lord Cecil’s grave and rather
moody one with keen watchfulness. “Now, how good of
you to think of that! Why, how many years is it since
you entertained in this house?”</p>

<p>The marquis compressed his lips.</p>

<p>“The last time was”—he paused a moment, then, as if
out of sheer bravado, went on—“the night before my
wife ran away from me! Not a pleasant omen for ‘dear
Cecil,’ is it?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill coughed behind his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, there must be no bad omens for the young couple,”
he said, rather confusedly. “And what date is the party
to be?”</p>

<p>“When you like,” replied the marquis, with the most
profound indifference. “I should enjoy it better if you’d
wait until I’m dead, but, as it is, I don’t care when it is.”</p>

<p>“Ah! then we must leave it to dear Lady Grace,” said
Spenser Churchill.</p>

<p>“I’m sending her a present,” said the marquis, listlessly.
“There are some things in that safe there; get them out
and choose something.”</p>

<p>“Now, how delightful,” purred Spenser Churchill.
“One of the old family jewels, eh, dear marquis? A
bracelet, or a ring, or something of that kind, I suppose?”</p>

<p>By this time Lord Cecil had reached the safe and opened
it, and Spenser Churchill, with a smile of childlike interest
and curiosity, went and stood beside him.</p>

<p>The safe was half-full of papers, and nothing but
papers, as it appeared, and Lord Cecil said so, and waited
for instructions.</p>

<p>“The cases are at the back,” said the marquis. “For
Heaven’s sake! don’t bother me over the business, or I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
shall regret my sudden and unusual generosity,” he added,
with a sneer.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil took some of the documents out, and revealed
a couple of jewel cases, and placing the former on
a chair, carried the latter to the marquis.</p>

<p>“These papers want arranging, dear marquis,” said
Spenser Churchill, and he lingered behind, as if casually;
but his eyes flashed over the litter of parchments with
keen and searching scrutiny.</p>

<p>“I dare say,” assented the marquis, indifferently.
“There are some wills of mine there, I think, but it doesn’t
matter. I shall live to make two or three more to add to
this collection,” and he glanced at Lord Neville maliciously.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill laughed, as if it were an excellent
joke, and Lord Cecil opened the cases and set them on
the small table beside the marquis.</p>

<p>“Are these what you want?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” said his lordship. “Choose something;
here, Churchill!”</p>

<p>“Am I to help in the selection? Really!” he exclaimed,
and leaned forward with such alacrity that he
overturned the chair upon which the deeds were lying,
and scattered them on the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry! Tut, tut, how clumsy of me!” he
exclaimed, apologetically, and he went down on his knees
and gathered up the papers.</p>

<p>“Let them alone, for Heaven’s sake!” snarled the marquis,
with cold irritation.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I’ll just pick them up,” murmured Spenser
Churchill, and with his back to the other two, he rapidly
examined each deed as he placed it on the chair. “Now,
then,” and he came to the table. “Ah! these are some
of the Stoyle jewels! How exquisite they are, and what
a pity they should have been hidden away so long! How
nice it is to reflect that they will soon adorn our beautiful
Lady Grace; eh, dear Cecil?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil did not answer, but moodily took the jewels
from their respective cases, and held them up for the
marquis’ inspection.</p>

<p>He eyed them with his usual cold impassibility, but
presently Lord Cecil held up a suite of pearls. It was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
antique and evidently priceless set, and Cecil was regarding
them with a listless interest when suddenly a strange
idea flashed across his mind that he had seen them before;
and yet he knew that he could not have done so. The last
person upon whose neck and wrists that priceless suite of
antique gems had shone was the ill-fated marchioness,
whom he had never seen, and whose end was still a mystery
to him. He was convinced that he had never seen
them before, and yet he seemed to remember them.</p>

<p>“Beautiful, beautiful!” murmured Spenser Churchill,
but looking at his companion’s face instead of the jewels
with a watchful scrutiny.</p>

<p>“Yes, they are,” said Lord Cecil, and he turned the remaining
jewels over as if searching for something.</p>

<p>“What are you looking for?” demanded the marquis,
his eyes fixed with a strange expression upon the pearls in
Lord Cecil’s hands.</p>

<p>“I am looking for the ring. I suppose there ought to be
one to make the set complete? There is everything else
here.”</p>

<p>The marquis’ face seemed to grow gray; then he
laughed a dry, harsh laugh.</p>

<p>“The ring is missing,” he said, almost inaudibly. “It
went with——”</p>

<p>“No, no,” cut in Spenser Churchill, softly. “I saw it
at the bottom of the box a moment ago; but, really, my
dear Cecil,” he continued, hurriedly, as if to prevent the
marquis contradicting him, “I don’t think they would suit
dear Lady Grace as well as some of these other things.
Now, if I might suggest, may I?” and, with smooth deftness,
he took the case from him and picked out a diamond
and ruby bracelet. “Now, that is the kind of thing which
would please dear Lady Grace. These pearls will be
more suitable when she is married.”</p>

<p>The marquis took the bracelet, and Lord Cecil fancied
that the clawlike hands trembled slightly, and looked at it
absently. Then he dropped it on the table and turned
aside with listless indifference.</p>

<p>“The pearl suite will do,” he said, curtly. “Take it
and give it to her. Will you be good enough to send my
man to me?” he added, as a hint that he desired to be rid
of their presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>“Good-day, sir, and thank you,” said Cecil, moving to
the door.</p>

<p>“Stop, my dear Cecil—the safe. You must put those
jewels away and lock it, you know.”</p>

<p>“Let him go. You can lock it,” said the marquis, with
icy impatience.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cecil will lock it,” murmured Spenser Churchill.
“I am going to get some lunch, marquis,” and with a nod
he went to the door, but there he turned. “Oh, would you
like a newspaper, marquis?” he asked, and as he waited
for the reply he watched Cecil lock the safe and deposit
the keys in the cabinet drawer.</p>

<p>“No!” answered the marquis, almost fiercely, and the
two men went out.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill locked his arm in Lord Cecil’s reluctant
one.</p>

<p>“Dear marquis!” he murmured, softly. “So generous
and—er—thoughtful! You have made him very happy,
my dear Cecil, and be sure that his happiness will find
its reflection in your own heart. Ahem! Did you notice,
my dear Cecil, how—er—unwell and, so to speak, generally
feeble he looked?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Cecil, gravely.</p>

<p>“No? Then perhaps—indeed, I fervently hope—that
it was only my fancy; but I certainly did think that I saw
a change in him since last I was here. I do hope it was
only fancy! The world could ill afford to lose so great
and kind-hearted a man as our dear marquis! And so
you are going to marry the beautiful and charming Lady
Grace! Ah, youth, youth! what a blessed possession it
is! How I envy you, my dear Cecil!”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” said Lord Cecil, curtly. “I’ll tell Lady
Grace, who will feel duly complimented, I’ve no doubt.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—tell her, you happy rogue!” said the philanthropist,
and, with a playful nod and laugh, he watched
Cecil go down the hall and out at the door.</p>

<p>Then his face changed to one of keen reflection, and, as
he went into the dining-room to the little lunch he had
ordered, he muttered:</p>

<p>“Yes, the one I want is there! and the keys are in that
drawer, which he always keeps locked. I must have that
will—but how?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>When the invitations to an evening party at the Stoyle
House were issued, they caused as much astonishment to
the recipients and the world at large as if the trustees of
the British Museum had announced their intention of giving
a dance at that revered institution.</p>

<p>Only a very few of the last generation remembered any
entertainment at Stoyle House, and they declared that the
rumor must either be false, or that the marquis had at last,
and very appropriately, gone out of his mind; and it was
not until signs of the vast preparations for the event made
themselves felt that the world began to realize the truth.</p>

<p>Then arose such a struggle and scramble for tickets as
occurs in connection with one of the events of the season,
and Lady Grace was worried and pestered for an invitation
as if it were a permit to Paradise itself.</p>

<p>For a couple of seasons she had been the acknowledged
belle, but now it seemed as if suddenly she had become
one of the veritable queens of society. Wherever she
went, she was surrounded by a crowd, eager to lay their
tribute of adulation at the feet of the beautiful girl who
had succeeded, where so many had failed, in securing
handsome Cecil Neville, the future Marquis of Stoyle.
Women who envied and hated her approached her with
faces wreathed in smiles and voices soft and affectionate.
Her carriage, or her horse, in the Park was surrounded
by men eager to claim acquaintance with the future marchioness,
who could give them invitations to so many
shooting and hunting parties “when the old marquis
died!”</p>

<p>And Lady Grace bore herself through it all with charming
moderation. She delighted in all this worship, but
it may be truly said, that she was never happier than
when Lord Cecil was by her side. Some of us tire of the
prize we scheme and toil so eagerly for; but in Lady
Grace’s eyes the prize she had so basely won increased in
value day by day.</p>

<p>She had loved him the first night they had met at
Barton Towers, and her love, perhaps by opposition and
the struggle she had made to win him, had grown into an
absorbing passion. She was restless and nervous when
he was absent, and those who knew her well could tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
when he was in the room or near at hand, by the joyous
smile on her lips and the soft glow in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Always thought that girl had no heart,” remarked one
keen observer. “Only shows how a fellow can be mistaken
in a woman. She’s as clean gone upon Cissy as a
girl can be.”</p>

<p>“And Cissy?” queried the man to whom he spoke;
“what about him?”</p>

<p>The cynic shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. Seems as if he’s got something on his
mind, and couldn’t get it off. Never saw a man so
changed in all my life; perhaps his happiness is rather too
much for him.”</p>

<p>And yet Lord Cecil’s conduct gave no cause for evil
comment. No man could be more attentive to his <i>fiancée</i>.
He was with her every day, was by her side at nearly all
the “at homes,” was seen at the crushes at concerts and
balls, her shawl upon his arm, the arm itself always at her
command; and yet the old “Cissy” had gone, and in its
place was the tall, grave-faced man, with the look as if he
had something on his mind.</p>

<p>The night of the party arrived. Some preparations
had been necessary, and they had been made with a lavish
hand. The big house, which had sheltered so many generations
of the Stoyles through so many London seasons,
was ablaze with lights, which shone upon the handsome
decorations of the great saloon and the magnificent
dresses of the women.</p>

<p>Only at one of the state balls could have been seen such
a display of diamonds, and very soon after the ball commenced
it was declared by the experienced that it would
prove the event of the season.</p>

<p>It was not until the fourth dance on the list had been
reached that the marquis put in an appearance. Lady
Grace, magnificently dressed—robed, one might almost
say—had been questioned concerning his absence by the
throng that surrounded her, but had shaken her head
with a charming smile as she answered:</p>

<p>“He has promised to come into the room, if only for a
few minutes, but I don’t know when he will come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>She was, by right of her beauty and position, the queen
of the brilliant assemblage, and she reigned in truly
queenly fashion. Lord Cecil, moving about as host during
his uncle’s absence, glanced toward her now and again,
and said to himself that if he needs must choose a mate,
he could not have chosen a more beautiful or more splendid
one. But he sighed as he made the admission, and
there rose before him the vision of Doris’ ivory-pale face,
with its wealth of dark hair and witching blue eyes; and
he would have given half that remained of his life to be
sitting at her feet once more—only once more!</p>

<p>He was roused from one of these fits of reverie by a
subdued murmur of interest and curiosity, and, looking
up, saw the tall, thin figure of the marquis entering the
room at one of the doors leading from his private apartments.</p>

<p>The clean-cut face was deadly pale, but the dark eyes
shone with a hard, steel-like brilliance, and the thin, cruel
lips wore a reflection of a smile as he came forward and
greeted those near to him.</p>

<p>There was no vulgar pushing and crowding, but somehow,
in an impalpable kind of way, a circle gathered round
him, and then the marquis of old, or a shadow and semblance
of him, shone forth. The polished wit, like a rapier
long disused, leaped from its scabbard and set the
group admiring and laughing as of yore. As he moved
from one to the other, addressing his courtly flattery to
the women and his biting cynicisms to the men, a feeling
of wonder ran through the room.</p>

<p>“By Heaven!” exclaimed an old man, who remembered
him in years gone by, “it is like a resurrection! It is like
going back a quarter of a century! That is the kind of
wit we were accustomed to, sir! Look at him, and compare
him with the young fellows of the present day! And
don’t tell me that we haven’t degenerated!”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil stood a little apart, looking on at the success
which the marquis was making, the enthusiasm which
he was arousing, when he felt a hand softly touch his arm,
and Spenser Churchill’s unctuous voice purred in his ear.</p>

<p>“Do you see the dear marquis, Cecil? Wonderful,
isn’t it? Quite like what he used to be, I assure you!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
Remarkable man. Really, it fills me with admiration and—er—astonishment.
Did you hear that brilliant repartee
of his at which they are all laughing?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Cecil, gravely.</p>

<p>“Astonishing! Ah, my dear Cecil he is a marvelous
man. They were saying that he was going to dance—a
square dance, of course, just a walk through a quadrille,
but I shouldn’t think—eh? Why, yes, he is—” he broke
off, smoothly, “actually is!” and followed by Cecil he
made his way toward a circle that surrounded the marquis
who was seen going toward Lady Grace.</p>

<p>“These young people have set me thinking of old times,
Lady Grace,” he said, in his clear, metallic voice. “Will
you dare to brave their ridicule by giving your hand to an
old man? Or perhaps you would prefer a more suitable
partner?” and he shot a sarcastic glance at Cecil, who had
now reached his side.</p>

<p>She bent toward him with perfect grace, and placed her
hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>A thrill of amazement and curiosity ran through the
room, and those near the two fell back. The set was
formed, and Lord Cecil found himself standing at one of
the sides, with a young girl for a partner.</p>

<p>“What a delightful man to have for an uncle,” she said,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he replied, absently, his eyes fixed on the
thin, white face.</p>

<p>The music commenced, the dance began, and the marquis,
with a grace which reminded those of his old friends
of the days when “Wicked Lord Stoyle” was in the prime
of his youth—and his wickedness—led Lady Grace to the
center. A crowd had collected round the set; all eyes
were fixed upon him and the lovely woman who bore her
triumph with such queenly self-possession, when suddenly
a cry—a shudder, rather—of alarm ran from lip to
lip; for the erect, stately figure was seen to swerve and
rock, and then stand still, as if rooted to the spot, with
its arms held above its head, and its starting eyes fixed
strangely on vacancy.</p>

<p>“Great Heaven! It’s a fit! He’s dying!” said some
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>Cecil sprang forward, and, just in time, caught him in
his arms.</p>

<p>Some one silenced the band, and the whole assemblage
became instantly mute.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil raised the motionless form in his arms—it
seemed to weigh nothing to him, so thin and emaciated
was it—and, through a lane of horrified spectators, carried
him up the broad stairs, and into his bedroom.</p>

<p>Three persons followed him—Lady Grace, Spenser
Churchill and the marquis’ valet—and entered the room
with him.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil laid his frail burden on the bed, and the
valet quickly unfastened the old-fashioned cravat.</p>

<p>“It is a fit, my lord!” he murmured, agitatedly. “I expected
it! I have been watching him from one of the
doorways. His face was so white, and—and strained—like——”</p>

<p>“Go for a doctor,” said Lord Cecil, quietly. “Grace,
go down, and get rid of these people.”</p>

<p>“Oh! come with me, Cecil!” she said, brokenly; “I—I
shall break down!”</p>

<p>“Yes, go with her,” said Spenser Churchill. “You need
not be more than a few minutes, and I’ll stay here with
him.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Cecil drew his arm within hers, and left
Spenser Churchill alone with the unconscious man.</p>

<p>Alone with him!</p>

<p>He waited until Lady Grace and Lord Cecil had left
the room; then, scarcely looking at the white, distorted
face, he searched the pockets of the helpless man, and
with a suppressed cry of satisfaction, darted to the cabinet,
got the keys and opened the safe.</p>

<p>Taking out two deeds engrossed, “The last will and
testament of the Marquis of Stoyle,” he thrust one in
the breast pocket of his coat and replaced the other in
the safe, and locked it, and returned the keys to the cabinet.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he done so, and taken his place at the
bedside, than Lord Cecil and the valet hurried in with a
doctor, who had been one of the guests.</p>

<p>He bent over the unconscious marquis and made his
examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>“Is he? Oh, don’t say that my dear friend is dead?”
exclaimed Spenser Churchill, with a sob.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil waited for the answer in silent horror.</p>

<p>“No, no, he is not dead! Open that window!” said
the doctor. “It is a fit produced by sudden excitement.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” murmured Spenser Churchill, devoutly.
“And will he recover, doctor?”</p>

<p>The doctor looked grave.</p>

<p>“I cannot say. If he should——” He hesitated, and
looked at Lord Cecil. “It is a very serious case, my lord;
a sudden collapse. The unusual excitement has been
too much for his lordship. He may recover, but if he
should”—he stopped, and touched his forehead—“I fear
it will be a bodily and not mental recovery.”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill drew back, and covered his face with
his hands.</p>

<p>“My poor friend!” he sobbed; and if he gave expression
to his thoughts, he would have added: “will not be
able to make a fresh will!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">IN THE TOILS.</p>


<p>The great marquis recovered consciousness by midday,
but he lay very weak and silent, the keen, hard face looking
like a mask carved in old ivory. Cecil Neville scarcely
left his side, and, though the marquis did not attempt to
speak, he turned his eyes upon him now and again with a
curious expression in them. Mr. Spenser Churchill was,
as became so well-known and tender-hearted a philanthropist,
most attentive and sympathetic, and he hovered
about the bedside, and shed the light of his benevolent
countenance upon the patient, as if he were the marquis’
brother. And him, too, the sick man regarded with an
expression of thoughtful watchfulness.</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill waited four days, then, hearing
from the doctors that the marquis might possibly remain
in his present condition for weeks, or even months, he
thought that he had better attend to the other threads of
his plot. It was time that Percy Levant secured Doris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>Everything in England was working wonderfully well for
Mr. Spenser Churchill, and, in anticipation, he could almost
see the accomplishment of his object and the reward
of all his scheming and toiling.</p>

<p>“It cuts me to the heart to leave the dear patient, Cecil,”
he said; “but I have most urgent business on the Continent,
connected with one of our great charitable societies,
and I really must go. I have the consolation,
however, of reflecting that I leave my dear old friend in
such loving hands as yours and dear Lady Grace’s. He
will, I know, receive every attention that affectionate
hearts can suggest.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cecil, rather grimly. “We shall neither
starve nor neglect him; don’t remain a moment longer
than you like. You had better leave your address.”</p>

<p>“Y—es,” said Spenser Churchill. “Dear me, I scarcely
know what address to give you. I shall be moving about
so much for the first few weeks; but perhaps you had better
write to Meuriguy’s, at Paris. You will telegraph
to me, of course. I shall be back as soon as possible.
And when I come,” he added, mentally, as he wrung
Cecil’s hand, “perhaps I may have the satisfaction of dealing
you a slight shock, my self-sufficient young friend!”</p>

<p>He started for Italy that same evening, and three days
later appeared in the garden of the Villa Rimini to find
that Doris had consented to be Percy Levant’s wife.</p>

<p>There was something so complete in the success of his
plans that Mr. Spenser Churchill was almost startled.
The marquis lying bereft of reason and helpless away in
England, and Doris Marlowe engaged to Percy Levant!
It was little short of marvelous!</p>

<p>“Now, if I could only see them married,” he murmured,
as he lay on the lawn smoking a cigarette, and
blinking placidly up at the blue sky; “if I could only see
them married, and the dear marquis would kindly remove
himself from this troublous world, I should be ten
thousand pounds richer in pocket, and be able to repay
my dear Lord Cecil for the many, the very many snubs
he has bestowed upon me. Ah, here comes Percy. How
the young man hates me! And yet I have been the means
of giving him a beautiful wife and a large fortune.
Strange how deeply ingratitude is engrained in the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
heart! Well, Percy,” he purred, “and how is dear Miss
Marlowe now? It was nothing serious, I trust? Only
the heat, my dear Percy? I noticed that the room was
hot, and the air quite heavy with flowers. I’m not sure
that too many flowers are wholesome; to some ultra-refined
sensibilities, like those of our dear Miss Doris, for
instance, their perfume is overwhelming. How is she?”</p>

<p>Percy Levant stood with folded arms looking thoughtfully
into vacancy, his handsome face grave and sombre.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe has gone to her own room,” he said,
in a low voice. “Yes, it may have been the heat and the
scent of the flowers.” As he spoke, he took the society
journal from his pocket and opened it. “What was it
Lady Despard was reading when—when Miss Marlowe
fainted, Churchill?” and he bent his dark eyes keenly
upon the placid face.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill touched his white, smooth forehead
with his forefinger.</p>

<p>“Really, my dear Percy, I forget! Wasn’t it something
about that floral <i>fete</i> to the Amalgamated Charity
Children? Or was it the account of Lady Brabazon’s
ball? Miss Marlowe’s sudden and alarming indisposition
so startled me that it drove the matter out of my head.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant looked at him fixedly, then opened the
paper and scanned it carefully; then his eyes flashed as he
came across the paragraph respecting Lord Cecil’s engagement,
and he read it aloud.</p>

<p>“That was it, was it not?”</p>

<p>“N—o, I don’t think so, but I really can’t be sure. To
tell you the truth I wasn’t paying much attention. You
see, I’d read the paper coming across.”</p>

<p>“It was this, and you know it,” said Percy Levant, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“Was it? I daresay. But what has that to do with
Miss Marlowe’s swoon?” inquired Spenser Churchill,
with a patient smile.</p>

<p>Percy Levant paced up and down, his head sunk upon
his breast.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he muttered, inaudibly; “but I will
know!”</p>

<p>“Don’t look so distressed, my dear Percy!” purred
Spenser Churchill, leaning his head on his elbow, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
watching him through half-closed eyes. “I trust there is
nothing to be really anxious about. Miss Doris will be
well and honor us with her presence at lunch, or at dinner,
at latest. Of course, I can understand your anxiety,
but don’t give way to it, my dear Percy. Will you come
and sit down? I want to talk to you for a few moments.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant stopped short in his pacing to and fro,
and looked down at him.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you about the marriage,” said
Spenser Churchill.</p>

<p>“What marriage?” demanded Percy Levant, with a
frown.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill opened his eyes and laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Why, your marriage, my dear fellow,” he returned;
“yours and Miss Doris’. I don’t know whether you agree
with me, but I am, on principle, strongly opposed to long
engagements. When two young hearts are yearning for
each other——Percy, this marriage must take place at
once,” he broke off with a sharp and sudden change of
voice.</p>

<p>Percy Levant watched him closely and in silence for a
moment.</p>

<p>“Why?” he asked.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill smiled blandly.</p>

<p>“For several reasons; one, and not the least, being my
anxiety to see two young people in whom I am deeply
interested, made happy; another, if I may be candid, is
because I am anxious to complete our contract and destroy
the bond,” and he touched his breast-pocket.</p>

<p>A strange expression came into Percy Levant’s face,
came and passed like a flash.</p>

<p>“You want your money?” he said.</p>

<p>“Naturally, and you want your bride! So that we are
of one mind, my dear Percy.”</p>

<p>“And what if I say I will go no further in this vile
business; if I say that I will no longer be a party in this
conspiracy against a helpless girl!” said Percy Levant in
a low voice, and with a sudden crimson rising to his face.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill smiled blandly.</p>

<p>“But you won’t say any such nonsense, my dear fellow,”
he retorted, blowing a thin wreath of smoke from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
his complacent lips; “and it would be nonsense, sheer
nonsense, for you couldn’t draw back if you would, because,
my dear Percy, you are so completely and madly
in love with her!”</p>

<p>Percy Levant grew pale, and he clenched his hands.</p>

<p>“You fiend!” he muttered.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Come, come, we had enough hard names last night!
If I am a fiend, as you call it, don’t you be a fool. Why,
my good sir, you have got everything you wanted, and,
like a spoiled child, you are still dissatisfied, and want to
quarrel with the person who has been your best friend.
What, give up charming Doris Marlowe! Tut, tut, you
couldn’t do it; now, could you?”</p>

<p>Percy Levant turned his head aside, and something like
a groan escaped his compressed lips.</p>

<p>“No, you couldn’t. And therefore I say that the
sooner the marriage takes place, and you have got for
your bride the beautiful young creature with whom you
are so madly in love, the better. ‘A bird in the hand,’ and
‘There is many a slip, etc., etc.’ You know the two old,
but exquisitely true, proverbs, I daresay. Get the marriage
over, my dear Percy!”</p>

<p>“You speak of a marriage, and we were engaged only
last night!” he said, after a pause. “Do you think she
would consent? How little you know her. Perhaps you
think”—with a bitter smile—“that she is as madly in love
with me as I am with her!”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, my dear fellow, I don’t think anything of the
kind. I think I can understand why Miss Doris has promised
to marry you. But if she doesn’t love you now, she
will do so. Oh, yes, believe me, with most women love
comes after marriage!”</p>

<p>A light shone in the dark eyes for a moment, then faded
out again, and left the handsome face grave and moody.</p>

<p>“I think she will consent—in fact, I am sure she will.”
He leaned forward on his elbow, and whispered the ensuing
words insidiously: “She must be made to!”</p>

<p>“Made to?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Tut, tut, don’t look so black. Moral force, not
physical, my dear Percy, is what I mean. Listen to me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
I think you will admit that, up to now, my judgment has
been pretty correct, and that I didn’t start you on a wild-goose
chase that morning in Soho, when I offered to give
you a beautiful wife, and make your fortune. Eh, my
dear Percy? Well, I’ll finish what I began, and here is
my little plan. Do you know Pescia?”</p>

<p>Percy Levant nodded.</p>

<p>“A charming little place, my dear Percy. So quiet and
secluded, and so much healthier than Florence. Now, if
I were a medical man I should say that Miss Doris wanted
a change, and that no place, within even easy distance,
could be more suitable than Pescia. Though I am not a
doctor, I think I shall venture to suggest to Lady Despard
that she and Doris go there for a few weeks.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant listened intently, his brilliant eyes covered
by their long, dark lashes, so that Spenser Churchill
could not see the expression that gleamed in them.</p>

<p>“Well, they go to Pescia, and you, of course, with
them. You are there, say, a fortnight or three weeks,
when I write to offer you an engagement at a large
salary, in Australia.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant did not move a muscle.</p>

<p>“It is a most tempting offer, but, alas! poor as you
are, you cannot bring yourself to leave your ladylove for
years, perhaps forever, as the song says. And what so
natural and reasonable as the suggestion that you should
marry her, and take her out with you? At first, she will
hesitate—oh! yes, certainly she will hesitate—but I
think—” with a smile, “I think I do not over-estimate
your powers of persuasion when I say that I am convinced
you will overcome her reluctance to so hasty a
marriage. There is a charming little English church in
Pescia—most charming!—the very church for a quiet
wedding. A <i>quiet</i> wedding, mark me, my dear Percy!
You see! Come admit that I am as thoughtful on your
behalf as even a parent could be!” and he laughed unctuously.</p>

<p>“To Australia!” said Percy Levant in a low voice.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill made a mocking gesture.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my dear fellow! Why should you go to
Australia? On the day after the wedding you and I will
have a little explanation. I shall have the happiness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
telling you whom you have married, and the extent of
your good fortune; of putting you in the way of paying
me that little bonus we agreed upon—and then you may
go where you please—London—Paris—Jericho!”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Percy Levant, slowly. “It is a clever plan.
And you will tell me nothing until after the marriage?
You will not trust me——”</p>

<p>The gentle philanthropist’s smile spoke volumes by way
of answer. It really meant, “Do you take me for a fool?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a clever plan,” repeated Percy Levant.
“But, clever as it is, I think you will spoil it, Spenser
Churchill.”</p>

<p>“I! Spoil it!” he echoed with reproachful indignation.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. Do you think Lady Despard will
not suspect that there is something wrong when you dog
our footsteps and follow us about——”</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill laughed.</p>

<p>“But I do not intend to inflict my presence upon you,
my dear Percy. I shall ask dear Lady Despard’s permission
to remain here at the villa, in charge, as it were,
during her absence. You see? So that there will be
nothing to be suspicious about.”</p>

<p>A curious expression, almost one of satisfaction, shone
for a moment in Percy Levant’s dark eyes.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said quietly. “Though not with us
you will be near at hand? And I am to come here the
day after the wedding?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Spenser Churchill, nodding complacently.
“You will come to me and obtain the key to the enigma,
and I flatter myself, my dear Percy, that you will, I fear,
alas, for the first time, overwhelm me with gratitude!
Ah, lucky, lucky boy! If I had had the good fortune in
early life to possess such a friend as I have proved myself
to you, where should I be now, I wonder?” and he sighed
unctuously.</p>

<p>“In gaol, I should say,” retorted Percy, grimly. Then
he added, quickly, “But I like your plan, and I shall do
my best to carry it out. As you say, it is too late to draw
back now——”</p>

<p>“Much too late,” laughed the philanthropist, “even if
you wished to, which you do not, my dear boy.”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” he assented, and he took a cigar from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
his case and lit it, his white, shapely hands trembling
slightly. “I am willing to follow your instruction; and all
I ask is that which you have consented to: that you keep
away from Pescia.”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill nodded acquiescingly.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I agree with you, that the less I am in
evidence the better.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, a footman came across the lawn with a
telegram.</p>

<p>It was from Lord Cecil, and had been forwarded from
Meuriguy’s. Mr. Spenser Churchill took it and opened
it.</p>

<p>“The marquis’ condition is unaltered. Cecil Neville,”
it ran.</p>

<p>He tore it into minute fragments.</p>

<p>“A request that I will speak at the annual meeting of
the Washerwomen’s Burial Fund next week. You see
what sacrifices I am making in your behalf, my dear
Percy,” he said, shaking his head. “I think I am rather
thirsty; it is this peculiar air, I suppose. A small brandy-and-soda,
now—will you join me, my dear Percy? No?”
and with a gentle sigh he ambled toward the house.</p>

<p>Percy Levant dropped down on the grass and smoked
furiously for some minutes, then he flung the cigar from
him as if he were too agitated to smoke.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll do it!—I’ll do it!” he muttered. “Oh, my
beautiful angel, for your sake—it is for your sake.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A POSTPONEMENT.</p>


<p>Some men take a great deal of killing; the Marquis
of Stoyle ought, according to medical rules and poetical
justice, to have died out of hand; but he clung to life
tenaciously, and not only refused to die, but got better!</p>

<p>In ten days from Spenser Churchill’s departure, his
lordship rallied, and, to the surprise of every one, including
the doctors, regained sufficient strength to enable
him to leave his bed.</p>

<p>But a great change had taken place; one of those extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
changes which baffle medical science and set
all its knowledge at naught. The marquis had not lost
his reason, but his memory.</p>

<p>He was perfectly sane, understood every word that
was said to him, and could converse with all his wonted
acuteness and sardonic cynicism, but he had forgotten
everything excepting those things which had occurred in
years long back. It was exactly as if the later years of
his life, with all their experience, had been wiped clean
from the tablets of his mind, and, as he sat in his easy
chair looking out of the window, he was under the impression
that his wife had just left him, and that Time
had put back the hands on life’s dial twenty years.</p>

<p>The doctors were both startled and puzzled. If he
had become actually insane and idiotic, they could have
understood it; but that a man should lose all hold upon
twenty years of his life, and yet be able to understand
what was said to him and converse rationally, was little
short of phenomenal.</p>

<p>They sent for Lord Cecil, who came hurriedly, and
was received by the old man with a cold, haughty courtesy,
as if they had not met for years.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Cecil,” he said. “You have altered
a great deal since I saw you last; you have grown,
grown very much. I suppose you think of entering the
army? Well, I will consider the matter. I imagine you
would do as much mischief as a civilian as you will do
as a soldier. Tell your father, my brother, that, though
I bear him no good will, I will do my duty by you. Ask
the steward to give you a five-pound note, and—you
may go now, please,” and Lord Cecil, dismissed like a
schoolboy, left the room, too embarrassed and confounded
to utter a word.</p>

<p>“What is to be done?” he said to the doctors. “Will
he remain like this? It is terrible, terrible!”</p>

<p>Sir Andrew shook his head.</p>

<p>“It is very extraordinary, very; but I must remind
you, Lord Cecil, that it might be worse. His lordship
is in possession of all his faculties, and, excepting this
remarkable loss of memory, is as sane as you and I. I
have had a long, and, I must add most interesting, conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
with him this morning, and he talked with all
his old brilliance——”</p>

<p>“And bitterness,” said the other famous doctor, under
his breath.</p>

<p>“As to how long this singular lapse of memory will
affect him, I really cannot say. It is an altogether unusual
case. It is very bad, my lord, I admit,” for Lord
Cecil was much moved by the old man’s condition; “but,
as I say, it might be worse. His lordship’s physical
strength is improving daily, we may say hourly.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil sighed.</p>

<p>“It is dreadful to hear him talk so strangely,” he said.
“Can nothing be done, no experiment be tried? Perhaps
if I brought Lady Grace?”</p>

<p>“Bring her ladyship, by all means,” said the doctor.
“There is no knowing what a familiar face may do. Yes,
bring her, Lord Cecil.”</p>

<p>Cecil jumped into a hansom, and returned with Lady
Grace, whom he took up to the marquis’ chair.</p>

<p>“Here is Grace, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Grace? Grace? What Grace?” demanded the old
man, with a hard, keen glance at the beautiful face he
used to know so well. “I have not the honor and pleasure
of the young lady’s acquaintance. Do me the favor
to introduce me, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Surely you know me, dear marquis!” said Lady
Grace, bending over him.</p>

<p>The old man took her hand, and turned it over in his,
with a vacant smile. “Let me see, Peyton calls this girl
of his Grace, doesn’t he? Are you Peyton’s daughter?”</p>

<p>“You know I am, my lord!” she said. “You remember
my father, your oldest friend!”</p>

<p>“Jack Peyton! Oh, yes!” he said, with his old, caustic
smile. “My oldest and best friend; he proved himself
so by running off with the girl I was going to marry.
And then I married Lucy——” His lips tightened, and
seemed to grow stiff and hard—“and she ran away, too.
I dare say she had reason. The child was a girl; it ought
to have been a boy, and I hated it because it was not
one. Yes, it ought to have been a boy, and cut out
Cecil. And now Cecil will be the heir. I beg your pardon,
Cecil,” he broke off with his sardonic smile, “I forgot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
you were present. Yes, it was a girl. Some one
told me that it was dead, and Lucy, too. No, I don’t
wear mourning; why should I?” with a hard, haughty
stare. “Let the man who went with her wear mourning;
I dare say he regrets her, the fool. He was an old
flame of hers. Spenser Churchill can tell you all about
him, for he helped me to get Lucy away from him.
Heaven knows what I saw in her to take so much trouble!
I don’t! Where is Churchill, by the way?” he
broke off to inquire.</p>

<p>“He is on the Continent, sir,” said Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a Pecksniff the fellow is! The biggest
hypocrite on the face of the earth, but useful—oh, yes,
useful! And so you are Grace Peyton, are you?” turning
his glittering eyes upon Lady Grace, who shrank back,
half-frightened. “Hem! I should think you’d make a
good match with Cecil.”</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten that we are engaged, Cecil and
I, marquis?” she murmured, bending over him.</p>

<p>“Engaged, are you?” he said. “Rather early, isn’t it?
But I’ve no objection. Engaged to Cecil, eh? By gad,
I pity you if he has any of the Stoyle temper! The
Stoyles are the worst husbands in the world, so they
say, and I think it’s true. He’ll make you wish you were
dead before you have been married twelve months!”</p>

<p>“Come away, Grace,” said Cecil, pale and stern, and
he led her out of the room.</p>

<p>“Oh! Cecil, I am sorry!” she murmured, clinging to
his arm, and looking up into his face. “And we were
to be married soon, too!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I am afraid the wedding must be put
off, Grace!” and, though he spoke in accents of regret,
a guilty thrill of relief shot through him. “Poor old
man! Poor old man! We were never on very affectionate
terms, but it hurts me to see him like this!”</p>

<p>“And he may remain like it for ever so long!” she
said, raising her eyes, as her head lay on his breast.
“For months, perhaps. Do—do you think it would
matter if we had a quiet, a very quiet, wedding, Cecil?”</p>

<p>He frowned.</p>

<p>“I am afraid it isn’t possible, Grace,” he replied, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
again he was conscious of the same guilty thrill of relief.</p>

<p>She drew a long breath, and pulled irritably at the lace
on her sleeve.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have been more awkward if he had died,”
she said, almost sullenly.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil looked down at her gravely.</p>

<p>“I am very glad he is not dead,” he said. “I hope,
and I think, he may recover completely. We can wait,
Grace.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she said, with an effort; “we can wait; but
it is terribly awkward, all the same, and people are talking
so.”</p>

<p>“Let them talk!” he said, almost sternly. “What do
I—or what should you—care what they say?”</p>

<p>A week passed, and the marquis still remained in the
same condition mentally, but physically he progressed
in a remarkable manner.</p>

<p>To all intents and purposes he was as well and strong
as he was before his sudden attack, and one morning
he rang for his valet, and said, in his old, haughty, listless
manner:</p>

<p>“It is very cold here, in London, Williams.”</p>

<p>“Cold, my lord? We are all complaining of the heat!”</p>

<p>“So you may be; but that does not affect me, if I am
cold,” retorted the marquis, grimly. “I shall go south!
Pack up what is necessary, and see that we start to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The valet was too well trained to exhibit any sign of
surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” he said, quietly. “Lord Cecil will accompany
us, I presume?”</p>

<p>“You do presume!” retorted the marquis. “Lord
Cecil will not accompany us! Great heaven, do you
think I want a schoolboy hanging to my coat tails? Certainly
not—we go alone! Let me see, it will be very
pleasant in Italy! Rome! No; not Rome, it will be too
crowded; and Florence is full of tourists at this time!
We will go to Pescia.”</p>

<p>“Very good, my lord,” said the man, and he left the
room and went straight to the doctors.</p>

<p>“Italy?” said Sir Andrew. “Well, yes, it will do his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
lordship no harm and may do him good. Pescia is a
quiet place and will suit the marquis. I will write to the
doctor over there and ask him to watch his lordship.
And he wants to go alone, does he? Well, I suppose
you can take care of him?”</p>

<p>The valet professed himself quite capable of doing so,
and in the end it was decided not to thwart the sick
man’s fancy.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil was consulted and came to see him.</p>

<p>“Will you not let me come with you, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Thanks, no,” replied the marquis. “Delighted as I
should be to have you as my companion,” with a bow, “I
must not forget that your military duties have a prior
claim upon you. No, I shall go alone. I am aware that
you all think I am dying, but I can assure you, with
some regret, that you are very much mistaken. You will
have to wait for the title a little while longer, Cecil Neville,”
and he smiled sardonically.</p>

<p>What could Cecil say or do but assist as far as he was
able in securing the comfort and safety of the old man,
who even in his weakness possessed a fiercer self-will than
most men can boast of in the prime of their strength?
They wrote to the English doctor at Pescia, engaged a
villa in the best part of the town, and sent over his lordship’s
traveling chariot and those servants whom he was
accustomed to have about him. And Cecil himself accompanied
the party across the channel, though even to
this short escortage the marquis was opposed.</p>

<p>“Great heaven!” he exclaimed, irritably. “I have
traveled half round the globe several times without your
assistance, and I cannot conceive why you should consider
it necessary to bore yourself, and me, too, by coming
across the channel.”</p>

<p>“You forget that you have been ill, sir,” said Cecil,
quietly, “and that it is my duty to see that your journey
is made as comfortably as possible.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” retorted the marquis. “It’s a pity you
couldn’t have arranged a calm passage; but you couldn’t
do that, and for the life of me I can’t think of anything
else you can do. Good-by. Don’t trouble to write, I
hate reading letters when I am abroad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>And this, with a cold touch of his thin hand, comprised
his adieu to his nephew and heir!</p>

<p class="center">“I LOVE HIM STILL.”</p>


<p>“Really, that was a very good idea of Mr. Spenser
Churchill’s,” said Lady Despard, looking round her, as
she leaned over the bridge which spans the river running
sleepily down to the sea. “I should never have
thought of coming to Pescia, but, then, I never have any
ideas of any sort, and Mr. Spenser Churchill is so clever,
isn’t he, Mr. Levant?” she added, turning her head lazily
to where Percy Levant sat upon the stone coping of the
bridge, looking down at the river, and now and again
glancing at the face of Doris, who stood with her eyes
fixed dreamily upon the perfect blue of the skies.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he is very clever,” he assented, quietly;
“very.”</p>

<p>“And I really think the change is doing Doris good,”
continued her ladyship, looking admiringly at the ivory
pale face and dark blue eyes; “I think she is better.
Not much to boast of in the way of color, perhaps, but we
have only been here ten days, and you never do run to
color, do you, Doris?”</p>

<p>Doris started.</p>

<p>“I—I beg your pardon,” she said. “I am afraid I was
not listening——”</p>

<p>Lady Despard laughed.</p>

<p>“What a dreamer you are, dear,” she said, banteringly.
“I often wish you would sell me your thoughts
for the proverbial penny; they should be worth it, judging
by your face. Does she sell them—or give them to
you, Mr. Levant?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and pushed a loose pebble
from the coping of the bridge into the water.</p>

<p>“‘My thoughts are all I have, but they’re my own,’”
he quoted. “Will you tell me what you were thinking
of, Doris?” he added, in a low voice.</p>

<p>A dash of color came into the pale face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>“They were not worth telling,” she said, with a little
twinge in her voice. “I—I scarcely know what I was
thinking about!”</p>

<p>“Just dreaming, dreaming,” said her ladyship.</p>

<p>“Well, you couldn’t have come to a more suitable place
than sleepy, old Pescia, where nothing happens, or has
happened since the Ghibellines and the Florentines used
to squabble and fight,” said Percy Levant. “By the
way, though, something has happened; there has been a
new arrival lately. I met a handsome carriage in the
Via Grandia, and was told that it belonged to some great
English milord, who had come for the benefit of his
health.”</p>

<p>Lady Despard yawned.</p>

<p>“I do hope it’s no one we know, and that we sha’n’t
be compelled to call,” she said. “Did they tell you his
name?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Percy Levant, “for a very good reason—no
native of Pescia could possibly pronounce an English
name. They make something awful out of Smith,
even.”</p>

<p>Lady Despard laughed.</p>

<p>“I think I shall go in,” she said. “This sun is making
me feel drowsy, and, as when I dream I fall asleep, it
would be awkward tumbling into the water. You need
not come, Doris,” she added, as Doris made a movement
to follow her, and, after a moment’s hesitation,
Doris remained.</p>

<p>It was seldom that she was alone with Percy Levant,
though they were engaged, and his manner toward her
was as full of respect, almost as full, indeed, of reserve,
as it had been before the night she had promised to be
his wife. Not once had he ventured to kiss her, and
when his lips touched her hand it was with a reverence
which was almost that of a subject for a monarch. And
certainly no monarch ever had a more devoted servant.
As Lady Despard said, Percy Levant was a model lover,
and she declared that his devotion almost made her wish
that he had proposed to her instead of Doris.</p>

<p>“I wish he had,” Doris had retorted, with a smile that
was rather too grave to accompany a jest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>They stood now in silence for a moment or two, then
he turned his head and looked at her.</p>

<p>“I am glad you stayed, Doris,” he said. “I have
something to tell you, to show you.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” she said, leaning on the bridge, and shading
her eyes with her hands, that she might the more easily
watch the upward flight of a hawk which had been hovering
over the plain.</p>

<p>“It is some news I have had,” he said, and he drew a
letter from his pocket and held it out to her, but kept
his fingers closed on it, as he added, quietly: “Before
you read it, let me tell you that I shall accept the offer
it contains. Now will you read it, Doris?”</p>

<p>She took it.</p>

<p>“It is from Mr. Churchill,” she said; “I know the
writing.”</p>

<p>He nodded, and she read the letter, and as she read
her face grew pale.</p>

<p>“To Australia?” she said, in a low voice; “and you are
going?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “And now the question I am going
to ask you, Doris, is—am I to go alone?”</p>

<p>“Are you to go alone?” she repeated, as if she did not
understand him; then, reading his meaning in his eyes,
she shrank back a little, and her face grew crimson, and
then white. “You mean that—that——”</p>

<p>“That you should come with me,” he said, in a grave
voice.</p>

<p>“But—but——” she glanced at the letter again, “he
says that you must start in a fortnight!”</p>

<p>“We could be married in less than that, Doris,” he
said, gently.</p>

<p>She clasped her hands tightly, as they rested on the
bridge.</p>

<p>“In a fortnight—in two weeks!” she said, with a little
catch in her breath.</p>

<p>“Is the idea terrible?” he murmured, with a touch of
sadness in his voice.</p>

<p>“No—oh, no!” she made haste to answer. “But it is
so—so sudden! Two weeks——!”</p>

<p>He watched her anxiously, with a strange and curious
watchfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it is a short notice, but, you see, it is Hobson’s
choice with me. Poor men must take what is offered
them, and I, as you know, Doris, am very poor, and this—well,
it is a wonderful offer!”</p>

<p>“It comes through Mr. Spenser Churchill,” she said,
as if speaking to herself.</p>

<p>His lips twitched, and he looked quickly at her.</p>

<p>“Yes—why?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—nothing,” she murmured, thoughtfully,
and with her brows knit; “but—it is so strange!”</p>

<p>“What is strange, dear Doris?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Ever since I have known him, Mr. Churchill seems
bound up and connected in some way or other with my
life!” and she sighed.</p>

<p>He leaned forward and averted his face, as she turned
her eyes toward him.</p>

<p>“It—it is strange, coincidental,” he said, in a dry
voice. “But—what is your answer, Doris? Stop!
Don’t think of me, think of yourself——”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I—I will go if you wish me,” she said, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>He took her hand—it was as cold as if she had been
bathing it in the river beneath them—and pressed it to
his lips.</p>

<p>“Thanks, dearest,” he said, and his voice trembled.
“You shall never regret your choice—never. I will say
no more,” and he let her hand fall, and moved away, as
if he could not trust himself to speak further.</p>

<p>A moment or two after he came close to her, and laid
his hand, with an almost imploring gesture, upon her
arm.</p>

<p>“Doris,” he said, and his voice rang solemnly, “you
think me selfish and exacting, I know——”</p>

<p>“You are always all that is good and kind to me!” she
broke in, her lips quivering, her eyes growing moist with
tears. “Am I to do nothing—give nothing—in return?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I understand!” he said. “I understand
more clearly than you guess, dearest. Try not to think
too hardly of me. Some day—before long, perhaps—you
will know how deeply and truly I love you!” and
he turned and left her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>Doris remained standing on the bridge, looking at the
sleepy river, with a dull pain in her heart and her eyes
half-blinded with the rush of emotion that seemed to
overwhelm her.</p>

<p>In a fortnight! In two short weeks! Not until this
moment had she fully realized what she had done in
promising to be Percy Levant’s wife; but now——! She
leaned her head upon her hands, and tried to crush down
the rebellious thoughts that rose within her. Tried to
wipe out, as it were, the remembrance of Cecil Neville,
which haunted and tortured her.</p>

<p>“I love him still!” she moaned. “I love him still, and
I am to be another man’s wife in a fortnight! Oh, if I
were only dead—if I were only lying at rest at the bottom
of the river here! In a fortnight! Oh, what have
I done, what have I done?” and she wrung her hands,
wildly.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, with an effort, she fought down the
mad remorse and misery, and, in a dull despair, murmured:</p>

<p>“What does it matter? Why should I not marry him—or
any one else? What can Cecil Neville ever be to
me, even if I were free? He will be the husband of
Lady Grace; he has forgotten that such a person as
Doris Marlowe ever existed; or, if he remembers me, recalls
me as the girl who served to amuse him for a few
days in the country. What a shame it is that I should
give a thought to him who has been so base and mean,
while this other, to whom I have pledged my word, is all
that is good and true! Marry Percy Levant! Yes, I
would marry him to-morrow if he asked me!” and, setting
her teeth hard, she turned to leave the bridge.</p>

<p>As she did so, a tall, thin old man, with a white, wasted
face, from which a pair of sharp gray eyes gleamed like
cold steel, came onto the bridge, and she made way for
him.</p>

<p>He was leaning on a stick, and, as he raised his hat in
courtly acknowledgment, he let the stick slip from his
thin, clawlike hands.</p>

<p>Doris stooped and picked it up, and, as she gave it to
him and he was thanking her in Italian, his piercing eyes
scanned her face with a cold earnestness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>Doris bowed and went on, but some impulse moved
her to look back after she had gone a few yards, and
she saw him leaning against the bridge, with his hands
pressed to his heart, and his face deathly white.</p>

<p>She was at his side in an instant, and had drawn his
wasted arm within her firm, strong one almost before
he knew of it.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are ill,” she said.</p>

<p>He started as her sweet, musical voice sounded in his
ears, and raised his eyes to her face.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said, evidently with an effort. “But I
have been ill, and—and I am a little weak, which,” he
added, with all the old courtesy, “is my good fortune,
seeing that it has procured me the—the happiness of
your assistance. You are English. I took you for an
Italian. My eyes are not so strong”—he stopped, from
sheer weakness, and leaned upon her arm heavily, if the
word can be used in connection with the lightness of
his frail form—“not so strong as they were. I have the
misfortune to be old, you see,” and he forced a smile.</p>

<p>“Let me help you to the seat there,” said Doris,
gently.</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you; but I could not think of
troubling a lady——”</p>

<p>Disregarding his apologies, she led him carefully to
the seat, into which he sank with a sigh of weary relief.
Doris looked at him anxiously. It was a striking face, and
a vague kind of idea crossed her mind that she had seen
it somewhere before to-day, but she could not fix the
time or place, and presently she found the keen, glittering
eyes fixed in a meditative scrutiny upon herself.</p>

<p>“You have been very kind to me, my dear young
lady,” he said, in a voice that still trembled a little; “very
kind. And you are English? Will you tell me your
name? I am an old man, and claim an old man’s privilege—inquisitiveness—you
see.”</p>

<p>“My name is Doris—Doris Marlowe,” said Doris,
seating herself beside him, and looking down the road
in the hope that a carriage might come up in which she
could place him.</p>

<p>“Doris Marlowe? No,” he shook his head; “I never
heard it before; and yet I fancied your face awakened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
some dim memories. Do you know me, Miss Marlowe?”</p>

<p>Doris looked at him, and shook her head.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied. She did not like to ask his name.</p>

<p>“Ah, perhaps that is as well,” he said, with a faintly
cynical smile; “I mean that I am not worth knowing.
And are you living here, Miss Marlowe? Your mother
must be a very happy woman, having so sweet a daughter,”
and he drooped his head toward her, with the old,
graceful salute.</p>

<p>A deep red stained Doris’ pale face.</p>

<p>“My mother is dead,” she said.</p>

<p>He put up his white hand, with a pleading gesture.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, my dear! Your father——”</p>

<p>“I have no father,” said Doris, almost inaudibly, and
with a strange pang shooting through her heart.
“There was one who was father and mother to me, but—he
is dead, too,” and her voice quivered.</p>

<p>“You are young to have seen so much trouble,” he
said, pityingly. “But you are living here with some
relative, is it not so?”</p>

<p>Doris shook her head.</p>

<p>“I have not a relative in the world,” she replied. “I
am living with Lady Despard. I am her companion.”</p>

<p>“Lady Despard?” he put his white hand to his head.
“Lady Despard? I—I think I know her. And you are
living with her? I envy her her companion, my dear.
I will do myself the honor of calling upon her. Tell me
your name again. I—I forget, sometimes. I am very
old, older than you think, because you see I am so
strong still. You smile?” sharply.</p>

<p>“No, no, I did not smile, indeed!” said Doris, quickly.
“But I do not think you are strong enough—you have
told me that you have been ill, you know—to walk about
alone.”</p>

<p>He sighed, and shrugged his shoulders, with a mirthless
smile.</p>

<p>“Alone. I have only a valet, and I hate to have him
with me. I had a wife once”—he stopped, and looked
darkly before him—“she left me—she died, I mean, of
course and I’ve no one else. I had a child, a little girl,
but she died, too. You see, I am like you somewhat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
though I have other relations who, doubtless, wish that I
would die also,” and he smiled, cynically.</p>

<p>Doris shrank a little, then, ashamed of the momentary
repugnance, said, gently:</p>

<p>“That is not true, I am sure. And now, will you tell
me where you live? I will come with you if you will let
me. Or will you come with me to Lady Despard’s, and
have her carriage?”</p>

<p>He shook his head and straightened himself.</p>

<p>“I have the Villa Vittoria,” he said.</p>

<p>Doris knew it. It was the largest, and, after Lady
Despard’s, the handsomest in Pescia.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it,” she said. “It is too far for you to
go alone. When you are rested—but there is no hurry,
we will stay as long as you like—I will go with you.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, my dear,” he said, looking at her
with a gentleness which assuredly was an unfamiliar expression
on that cold, haughty face. “Very! I will rest
a little longer, if I may.”</p>

<p>He sat silent for a short time, and Doris heard him
murmuring her name several times, and then he looked
up and sighed.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t remember, and yet——” he passed his
hand over his forehead with a wistful, puzzled look in
his keen eyes. “I am ready now, my dear young lady,”
he said, presently. “You see, I accept your kind offer,”
as he placed his hand upon the arm Doris offered him.
“Not so long ago, fair ladies were wont to rest upon my
arm; now the order is changed. One gets old suddenly!”
he added, with a grim smile. “And I have been
ill. I think I told you. Yes, very ill. They thought I
was dead; but”—with a gesture of defiance—“my race
die hard—-die hard! And you have no father or mother?
That is sad! Did I tell you I had a little girl once?
She died! Yes, she died!” His head drooped for a
moment. “If she had lived and stayed with me, I should
have had her arm to lean upon. By Heaven, I never
thought of that before!” he exclaimed, in a suppressed
voice, and his head sank lower.</p>

<p>They crossed the bridge in silence, and reached the
Via Grandia, where Doris saw a man, whom she took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
for a servant, hurriedly cross the road and approach
them.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are ill, my lord,” he said, touching
his hat. “I missed you on leaving the chemist’s——”</p>

<p>The old gentleman drew his hand slowly from Doris’
arm, and took the servant’s.</p>

<p>“This is my man, Miss Marlowe,” he said, “and I shall
not need to tax your kindness and patience any longer.
How deeply grateful I am for that kindness and patience
I cannot tell you. But for you——” He stopped expressively.
“Will you tell Lady Despard that I shall
have the honor of calling upon her to-morrow, to congratulate
her upon having so sweet and beautiful a
friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Doris, allowing her soft, warm hand to
remain in his, which seemed to cling to it confidingly.
“But you have not told me your name yet?” she added,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Have I not?” he said; “I am the Marquis of Stoyle,
my dear.”</p>

<p>Doris recoiled, and drew her hand away so suddenly
that his thin, feeble one fell abruptly to his side.</p>

<p>“The Marquis of Stoyle!” she echoed, every vestige of
color leaving her face. “Yes, I will tell her, my lord,”
and she turned and walked quickly away.</p>

<p>The marquis looked after her with knitted brows—looked
so long that the valet gently pressed his arm as a
reminder.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—I am coming!” exclaimed the old man,
impatiently. Then he said, “Do I know that young lady?
You saw her—do I know her? She has been very kind
to me—very!”</p>

<p>“No, my lord, she is a stranger to me,” replied the
man.</p>

<p>“A stranger. Yes, yes. And yet——”</p>

<p>And, with knitted brows and troubled look in his eyes
he permitted his man to lead him away.</p>

<p class="center">OUT OF THE PAST.</p>


<p>“So the illustrious visitor turns out to be the great
Marquis of Stoyle!” exclaimed Lady Despard, with a
laugh of surprise. “The Marquis of Stoyle! And you
have been leading him about like a blind beggar? How
I wish I had been there to see you! But it seems to
have upset you, dear,” she added; “you look really pale
now, and—why, you haven’t been crying?” and she drew
Doris beside her on to the lounge.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t been crying,” said Doris, quietly; then,
after a pause, she said, gravely, “I have promised to
marry Percy Levant in a fortnight’s time, Lady Despard.”</p>

<p>Her ladyship started.</p>

<p>“In a—what time did you say? A fortnight! Oh,
nonsense! No wonder you look pale! I think it is a
shame you should try to impose upon my credulity,
Doris; for, of course, it is only a joke!”</p>

<p>“It is sober earnest, dear Lady Despard,” said Doris;
and then she told her of the letter of Spenser Churchill
containing the offer of an engagement for Percy Levant.</p>

<p>“And you intend to marry him and go with him!
What on earth shall I do without you? What shall I
do? What a wicked girl you must be to entice me into
loving you so, and then to leave me! Why, I didn’t expect
this dreadful marriage to take place for at least two
years, and now—! Two weeks! You must love him
very dearly, Doris.”</p>

<p>“I respect him very highly,” said Doris. “He is not
like some men—” she sighed—“he is true and steadfast,
and he—he really cares for me, I think,” in a low voice.
“Why should I not make him happy if I can?”</p>

<p>“Really cares for you! Yes, I should think he does;
why, child, he worships every inch of ground those little
feet of yours tread on. And so he might, considering
the many others who would be only too happy to take
his place. And why should you make him happy?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
Well, I don’t know. But it seems to me, dear, that you
are one of those women who consider that they were
only born to make others happy. I only hope that you
will make yourself happy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I shall be as happy as I deserve,” said Doris
with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“And you have quite made up your mind?” demanded
Lady Despard.</p>

<p>“Quite,” said Doris.</p>

<p>“Then the only thing to be done is to grin and bear
it, for I know the stiff-necked, resolute kind of young
person you are. Oh, there is one other thing we must
do: we can set about getting your things ready.”</p>

<p>“I shall not want many,” said Doris; “we are both
very poor, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Lady Despard, dryly. “All the
same, I suppose you will go decently clad.”</p>

<p>“And the wedding is to be very quiet,” said Doris,
pushing back the hair from her forehead with a weary
little gesture; “quite quiet. I don’t want any bridesmaids—”</p>

<p>Lady Despard shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well; have it all your own way. You shall
be married at midnight, and in darkest secrecy, if you
like. And in a fortnight! Great heavens! Why, it
scarcely gives one time to make a couple of dresses.”</p>

<p>“Which are all I shall require,” said Doris, with a
smile. “Dear Lady Despard, you forget that it is not
your sister who is going to be married, but only your
companion.”</p>

<p>Lady Despard moved away with a despairing gesture.</p>

<p>“I only wish you were my sister. I would show you if
you should make ducks and drakes of your future in this
way.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let us talk about it any longer,” said Doris, rising
and stretching out her arms as if she were ridding
herself of some incubus.</p>

<p>“No, the better thing to do is to act and not talk.
Put on your hat, and let us go down to the shops and
see if there is anything decent we can buy. A fortnight!
I rather liked Percy Levant on the whole, but now I feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
as if I hated him. I wish to Heaven, Spenser Churchill
had not sent him with us!”</p>

<p>Apparently the Pescia drapers had something decent
on sale, for her ladyship made purchases so extensive as
to alarm Doris, who, when she remonstrated, was told to
mind her own business; and the next two or three days
were occupied in consultation with dressmakers and
milliners; and Lady Despard had quite forgotten the
Marquis of Stoyle and his promised visit.</p>

<p>But Doris had not. And often as she sat, surrounded
by “materials” and bonnet shapes, she thought of the
strange meeting with the man who had stepped in between
her and Lord Cecil, and robbed her of her lover.</p>

<p>How surprised he would have been if she had said:</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, my lord. You are the man who has
wrecked my whole life, and broken my heart!”</p>

<p>And yet that was what he had done; for in losing Cecil
Neville she had lost all that makes life worth living.</p>

<p>Was there a single night in which, in feverish dreams,
she did not hear his voice, and feel his passionate kisses on
her lips? Was there a single morning on which she did
not wake with that dull aching of the heart which some
of us know so well! And she was to marry another
man in a fortnight!</p>

<p>During these two days Percy Levant was absent. He,
too, had to make preparations for the approaching wedding,
and, strange to say, Doris missed him. He had
been so like her shadow for months past, always near
her and ready, and promptly ready, to forestall her lightest
wish, that his absence made itself felt.</p>

<p>On the third day Lady Despard and she were sitting in
the former’s boudoir, literally up to their knees in millinery,
when a footman brought in a card.</p>

<p>“Can’t see any one this afternoon,” said Lady Despard.
“Unless they understand and can undertake plain
sewing. Who is it, dear?”</p>

<p>Doris took the card.</p>

<p>“The Marquis of Stoyle,” she answered, falteringly.</p>

<p>Lady Despard rose in her usual languid style.</p>

<p>“The marquis! Oh, I think we must see him, dear.
He has come to pour out his gratitude——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>“It isn’t the marquis, my lady, but his valet,” said the
footman.</p>

<p>Lady Despard sank back into the midst of the whirlpool
of muslin.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, show him in.”</p>

<p>“Here, my lady?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m too busy to go to any one short of a
marquis.”</p>

<p>The valet, a grave, distinguished-looking man, who
might well have been taken for a marquis, or, for that
matter, a duke, entered a moment or two afterward, and
bowed.</p>

<p>“His lordship’s compliments, my lady, and he would
be glad to know how Miss Doris Marlowe is.”</p>

<p>Lady Despard jerked her thumb lightly toward Doris.</p>

<p>“That is Miss Marlowe.”</p>

<p>The valet bowed respectfully—very respectfully—to
Doris.</p>

<p>“His lordship is very ill, miss; or he would have done
himself the honor to wait upon you to thank you for
your great kindness to him,” he said.</p>

<p>Doris’ face flushed for an instant.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she said, bending over her work; “but I
did very little, as the marquis knows.”</p>

<p>“He is very ill, miss—that is, he is very weak,
and——” he hesitated, “and he requested me to say that
he should deem it a very great favor, indeed, if you
would come and see him. He wished me to say that, if
he could have crawled—crawled was his word, my lady”—turning
to Lady Despard, “he would have come himself.
But he is quite confined to his room, and perfectly
unable to leave it. The marquis is an old man,
you see, my lady, and has been ill, very ill.”</p>

<p>Lady Despard looked at Doris and seemed to wait her
reply; and the valet crossed his hands and also seemed
to wait, respectfully and patiently.</p>

<p>Doris’ white brow wrinkled painfully, and she laid a
tremulous hand upon Lady Despard’s arm.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” she said, in a troubled voice.</p>

<p>“His lordship has spoken of you several times, miss,”
said the valet, in an earnest tone; “indeed, he has talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
of little else since he came home. He is very old, you
see——”</p>

<p>Doris’ gentle heart melted at the repetition of this
simple formula.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” she whispered to Lady Despard.</p>

<p>Her ladyship shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“I suppose you had better go. Of course you will go.
Why, you know you couldn’t resist an appeal of this
kind!”</p>

<p>Doris looked before her with wistful, troubled eyes for
a moment or two, then she laid down the work she was
engaged on.</p>

<p>“I will come with you,” she said.</p>

<p>When she re-entered the room with her hat and jacket
on, she looked round, and taking some flowers from one
of the vases, quickly rearranged them, and then said:</p>

<p>“I am ready.”</p>

<p>“I will get a carriage, my lady——” said the valet; but
Doris shook her head.</p>

<p>“It is no distance; I would rather walk.”</p>

<p>Lady Despard waved her hand to her with a smile
made up of affection and amusement.</p>

<p>“Another conquest, my dear,” she said. “It’s a pity
Percy Levant isn’t a curate; you would have made such
an admirable district visitor.”</p>

<p>On their way through the quiet streets the valet, answering
Doris’ questions, gave her some information respecting
the marquis’ condition.</p>

<p>“It was the excitement of the grand party, you see,
miss,” he said. “The party given in Lady Grace’s
honor, the young lady who is to marry my Lord Cecil,
that did it. His lordship isn’t used to excitement, and it
was quite against Lord Cecil’s wish that the party was
given, but the marquis was so delighted at the engagement
that he would insist—I’m afraid I’m walking too
fast for you, miss,” he broke off, as he glanced at Doris’
face, which had grown pale and wan.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she said, quickly. “It—it is rather warm.
Lady Grace is very beautiful, is she not? Yes, I know
she is beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, miss; her ladyship is one of the acknowledged
beauties, as I dare say you are aware.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Doris, raising her nosegay to her face to
hide the quiver of the lips. “And—and Lord Cecil”—how
little the man guessed the effort it cost her to speak
the name!—“he is very much attached——” she stopped,
remembering that it was rather indiscreet to discuss his
master’s affairs with this man.</p>

<p>“Attached to her ladyship, miss?” he said, with perfect
respect. “Yes, oh, yes; how could he be otherwise?”
He seemed to hesitate a moment, then he said, rather
reflectively, “Lord Cecil has rather changed of late.”</p>

<p>“Rather changed?” said Doris, faintly.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, miss. He used to be rather wild, and certainly
always in the best of humors, what would be described
as light-hearted. I used to say that it made one
laugh one’s self to hear his laugh, so free and blithesome
it was, so to speak. But he’s got quieter of late, and we
hear him laugh scarcely at all now. But perhaps you
know his lordship, miss?”</p>

<p>A scarlet wave of color rose and passed over Doris’
face, and she shook her head silently.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, miss, you wouldn’t have known him for the
same person. Perhaps it’s the responsibility of this engagement
and the marquis’ illness.”</p>

<p>“He—is not here?—here at Pescia?” she asked, stopping
short suddenly, with a look of alarm.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, miss; or of course he would have brought the
marquis’ message instead of me. Oh, no; it was the
marquis’ wish that he should come on the Continent
quite alone, and Lord Cecil remained, very reluctantly,
in England. Of course, I should take upon myself to
send for him if the marquis got seriously worse. This
is the house—villa, as they call it,” and he conducted
Doris into the miniature palace which his agents had succeeded
in renting for the marquis.</p>

<p>Doris waited in the—literally—marble hall, while the
valet went upstairs to convey the result of his mission to
his master, and she employed the few minutes before his
return in composing herself.</p>

<p>She was going, in obedience to his whim, to sit beside
the bed of this sick old man, who had robbed her of her
lover and wrecked all her life, the Marquis of Stoyle, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
whose request or command Lord Cecil had abandoned
her!</p>

<p>“If any one had told me that I should have done this
thing,” she mused, in sad wonderment, “with what scorn
I should have repelled the suggestion; and yet—I am
here. And, what is more wonderful still, I cannot hate
him—could not, if I tried. Is it because he is so old,
and ill, and helpless, and looks so unhappy? Only the
wretched can feel for the wretched, they say,” and she
sighed as she followed the man up the stairs into a carefully-shaded
room.</p>

<p>The great marquis lay upon a couch wrapped in his
velvet dressing-gown, the brightness of which seemed to
heighten the effect of his pallid, wasted face, with its
piercing eyes shining like brilliants in their hollow, dark-ringed
sockets.</p>

<p>He made an effort to rise as she entered, but fell back
with an apologetic wave of his emaciated hand.</p>

<p>“You see how helpless I am, my dear!” he said;
“worse than when you so generously came to my aid the
other day. And so you consented to gratify the sick
fancy of an old man, and have come to see me!”</p>

<p>Doris drew near and took the hand he extended to her,
and as she bent over him a strange, mysterious feeling of
pity thrilled through her.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry to see you so weak, my lord,” she said,
gently; “but you will be better when the weather is
cooler.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he assented, eagerly. “Oh, yes; I shall
get better! It is only a passing weakness! I have been
very ill—I told you? Yes, I am very strong. We
Stoyles have the constitution and”—with a grim smile—“the
temper of Old Nick! Yes, I shall get better.”</p>

<p>“I have brought you some flowers,” said Doris.</p>

<p>The valet came forward with a vase, but the marquis
waved him back.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “Give them to me! Give them to
me,” and he took them from her with a courtly eagerness.
“Ah, beautiful; and you were so gracious as to
think of them! They are almost as beautiful as yourself;
but not more pure, not more innocent or pure,” he
added to himself, with a strange, wistful gravity, as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
eyes rested on her sweet face, “whose goodness lay open
to all men’s eyes,” as the poet says.</p>

<p>The valet came forward again to arrange the pillows,
which had slipped down, and the marquis’ face flashed
angrily.</p>

<p>“Go, go!” he said, irritably.</p>

<p>The man drew back with unmoved countenance, and
Doris leaned forward.</p>

<p>“Let me put them more comfortably for you, my lord,”
she said.</p>

<p>He allowed her to do it, without a word or sign of protest
or resentment, and sank back with a sigh.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, woman, in our hours of ease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Uncertain, coy, and hard to please;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When pain and anguish wring the brow,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Scott! Walter Scott! I can understand that now—now
you are here! Yes, a ministering angel!”</p>

<p>He seemed lost in thought for a moment, then he
turned his keen eyes upon her inquiringly.</p>

<p>“You look pale and sad. Have you been in trouble?
I have no right to ask, you will say; but curiosity is an
old man’s privilege, remember, my dear.”</p>

<p>“‘Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward,’
my lord,” said Doris, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he said, knitting his brows “Yes. Trouble we
make for ourselves; but sorrow must have been unmerited
in your case, child. Tell me——” he stopped short and
sighed. “I am forgetting,” he said. “Why should you
tell me? I am not your father——” he stopped again.
“Did I tell you that I had a daughter once? She is dead.
If she had lived she would have been about your age, I
think. I wish——” again he stopped, and the proud lips
quivered slightly. “I have neither son nor daughter;
only a nephew, who, doubtless, thinks I am an unconscionable
time dying; and he is right. It is time that
there was a new Marquis of Stoyle.”</p>

<p>Doris looked down.</p>

<p>“I—I think you do him an injustice, my lord,” she
said.</p>

<p>He laughed the old cynical laugh.</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t, I’ve no doubt Grace does. Lady Grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
Peyton, the girl he is going to marry,” he explained, “is
a clever girl; too clever for Cecil,” and he smiled half-scornfully.
“She will have all the brains, and, perhaps, he
will have all the honesty. Yes, I’ll say that for him; he
may be a fool, but he’s no knave. A knave would have
been too sharp for us——” He put his hand to his brow
as if his memory were slipping from him and he was endeavoring
to keep a hold upon it. “Did I tell you about
him and Lady Grace? I think I told you.”</p>

<p>Doris shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, my lord,” she replied, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>“No? I thought——” He paused, and looked round
with a helpless sigh. “I have forgotten it now. Spenser
Churchill could tell you. It will amuse you.” He smiled
with childish enjoyment. “I wish I could remember, but
I can’t. My memory is worse, much worse since my illness;”
and he sighed again.</p>

<p>“Do not distress yourself, my lord,” said Doris. “You
shall tell me when you remember it, if you like.”</p>

<p>He inclined his head.</p>

<p>“One time, not so long ago, I could remember everything,”
he said, with a forced smile which was infinitely
pitiable. “Not a face or a story but I could carry it in my
mind, and now”—he looked at her apologetically—“I have
actually forgotten your name, who have been so kind to a
feeble old man, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Doris Marlowe,” said Doris.</p>

<p>He repeated it twice or thrice; then shook his head.</p>

<p>“Yes, a pretty name. I don’t think I ever heard it before.
My little girl’s name was Mary. They wanted to
call it Lucy, after her mother; but there has always been
a Mary Neville—until now. I told you she died, did I
not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” said Doris, soothingly.</p>

<p>“Y—es,” he repeated, musingly. “If she had lived I
should have had some one, like yourself, to see me
through the last mile of life’s race—the last mile. I kept
race horses once. I’ve done and seen everything in my
time. Wicked Lord Stoyle they called me. But through
it all I was never so bad as some. Spenser Churchill, for
instance——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Spenser Churchill has been very good to me, my
lord,” said Doris, gently.</p>

<p>The keen, piercing eyes opened upon her with amazement.</p>

<p>“Good to you!—Spenser Churchill? You are jesting,
child. He was never good to any one, man or woman!”
he laughed. “Spenser Churchill. Why, it was he
who——” He stopped, with a troubled look on his face.
“No—I’ve forgotten—it has slipped me again. It is something
Grace was in, too. Clever woman, Grace; too clever
for Cecil. But I had my way. Yes! I had my way.”</p>

<p>Doris rose.</p>

<p>“I must go now, my lord,” she said, faintly.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he said, wistfully. “Yes, I suppose so. It was
very good of you, my dear, to humor an old man’s whim.
Let me look at you,” and he raised himself on his elbow.
“You are very pretty. Did I tell you I had a daughter?
Yes, yes. I think—it is only a fancy, this—that she would
have looked like you. He will be a happy man who wins
that beautiful face and gentle heart!”</p>

<p>Doris’ face flushed, and her eyes dropped, and his keen
ones noted her embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said; “there is some one already, is there
not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” said poor Doris, in a low voice.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Who is he? What is his name? But it’s
no use telling me; I can’t remember, you see! I should
like to see him. Will you ask him to come and see me,
an old man on the verge of the grave? You can say that,
though it isn’t true! No, I’m worth twenty dead men
still,” and he raised himself, and glared at the opposite
wall with a proud, cold hauteur, which made Doris
shrink, for suddenly there flashed upon her mind the night
Jeffrey had taken her to Drury Lane, and she had seen the
old, stern-looking man in the box; and this was he! She
remembered and recognized him now.</p>

<p>She rose trembling, and filled with a vague fear.</p>

<p>“Must you go? Thank you for coming to me! Remember,
tell the fortunate man who has won you that I
shall esteem it a favor if he will bring you to see me again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
I should like to congratulate him upon the treasure he has
got.”</p>

<p>His shaking hand rested in her soft palm for a moment,
then he fell back with a sigh; but immediately afterward,
as she left the room, she heard him address his valet in a
dead, cold voice.</p>

<p>Doris went home greatly agitated.</p>

<p>“Your visit has been a trying one, I am afraid, dear,”
said Lady Despard, regarding her pale face with sympathetic
curiosity. “Was he a very irritable old man? I’ve
heard all sorts of stories about him.”</p>

<p>Doris sighed.</p>

<p>“He is very ill and old,” she said. “He—he was very
kind and gentle to me,” and, though she could scarcely
have told why, her eyes grew moist.</p>

<p>“Well, he would have to be a perfect monster, with a
heart of stone, if he had been anything else than kind and
gentle to you. And now I have some good news for you.
Percy Levant has come back. All his preparations are
complete, he says, for the happy event——”</p>

<p>Doris started. She had almost forgotten Percy Levant
in the excitement of the interview with the marquis, and
the memories and emotions he had evoked.</p>

<p>“I should think he had been working pretty hard or
worrying about something,” continued Lady Despard,
“for he looks as grave as a judge, and hadn’t a laugh in
him. Oh, here he comes.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant entered the room as she spoke, and Lady
Despard, murmuring some excuse, left the two young
people alone.</p>

<p>He took Doris’ hands, and looked down at her with a
grave tenderness that, if she had met his gaze, would have
startled her by its sadness.</p>

<p>“Well, Doris,” he said, “I have come back, and all is
ready.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you have come back,” she said, in her low,
sweet voice. “Lady Despard has missed you terribly.”</p>

<p>“And you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“And I!” she answered, lifting her eyes to his face for
a moment. “Yes, I have missed you. I have not so many
friends that I can afford to lose one without missing him.”</p>

<p>“Friend!” he said, almost inaudibly. “Well, yes, I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
truly your friend. And you don’t regret—you have no
misgivings as to the future, Doris?”</p>

<p>She paused, almost perceptibly, then, in a still lower
voice, replied:</p>

<p>“No, I have no regrets, no misgivings. I—I trust you
entirely.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearest,” he said, and he bent and kissed her
hands, “and you may do so, I think, entirely. I must go
and dress now.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” she said, falteringly. “I have something
to tell you,” and she told him of her meeting with
the marquis and her visit to him.</p>

<p>“The Marquis of Stoyle!” he said, as she mentioned his
name, and he let her hands drop suddenly. “The Marquis
of Stoyle!” and his eyes rested upon her face with a
curious expression.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, her heart beating. “Do—do you know
him?”</p>

<p>“No; but I have heard of him,” he replied. “Who has
not? He is the uncle of Lord Cecil Neville;” and he
watched her closely.</p>

<p>Her face flushed for an instant, then grew pale again.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, simply. “And will you come with me
to see him? He is very ill, worse than he thinks, and—and
nearer death than he would believe.”</p>

<p>“I will come with you if you wish it,” he said. “I will
do anything you wish, now and always, Doris.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do wish it. I don’t know why,” she said, with
a smile that was rather troubled, “but I do wish it.”</p>

<p>“Then we will go,” he said, as a matter of course. “And
now I’ll go and make myself presentable.”</p>

<p>With his change of clothes he seemed to have got rid
of the gravity and melancholy which Lady Despard had
remarked upon; and that evening he was the Percy Levant
of old, causing Lady Despard to laugh until she declared
that she was tired, and bringing a smile even to
Doris’ quietly brooding face.</p>

<p>Once or twice Lady Despard referred to the now rapidly-approaching
marriage day, but when she did so he
evaded the subject and changed it, as if it were too close
to his heart to be spoken of lightly.</p>

<p>“After all, dear,” said Lady Despard, as she came into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
Doris’ dressing-room for a few minutes’ chat before going
to bed, “I don’t know that you could have done better.
He loves you to distraction, and he’s awfully clever
and light-hearted. You’ll never know what it is to be
bored for a single moment,” and her ladyship, recalling
the many wearisome hours she had endured in the society
of her dear departed, sighed; “and he is really the handsomest
man I have ever met. Yes, I don’t know, dear,
that you haven’t done wisely in choosing him. But I
wish he had some money and a title. I have a fancy that
you ought to be called ‘my lady.’ There is something
about you—a certain dignity——”</p>

<p>Doris swung her thick hair over her shoulders, and
looked down at Lady Despard’s pensive face with a smile.</p>

<p>“That’s ‘spoke sarcastic,’ as Artemus Ward would say,”
she said. “I ‘my lady’! Plain ‘Mrs.’ will suit me better
than anything grander, I think.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you,” said Lady Despard; “but it
can’t be helped now, and, after all, one is none the happier
for a title; and I do hope you will be happy, dear!
You deserve it so very much,” and she put her arm round
the slim waist and kissed her.</p>

<p>Doris slept little that night. The white, haggard face
of the old man haunted her, and, strangely enough, the
frank, handsome one of Lord Cecil, in all its bravery of
youth and strength, mingled with it in an inextricable
fashion.</p>

<p>At breakfast Percy Levant was still in a bright humor,
and jested even about their visit to the marquis.</p>

<p>“Not content with playing the Lady Charitable herself,
you see, Lady Despard, Doris must needs make a
district visitor of me! What part do I take now? Am
I to carry the basket with the tea and tracts, or what?
Perhaps, when you get there, the marquis will have forgotten
your existence.”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure he is too gallant to do that,” interrupted
Lady Despard.</p>

<p>“Or perhaps he will regard my presence as an intrusion,
and order me to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Anyway,
I suppose we have got to chance it, so put on your
things, Doris, and let us get it over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>Doris filled a basket with some flowers, and a bunch of
grapes—“just to keep up the character,” Percy Levant
remarked—and the valet received them in the villa with
an air of respectful gratitude.</p>

<p>“His lordship has been inquiring for you all the morning,
miss,” he said. “He has spoken of nothing else,
scarcely,” he said, as he led them upstairs.</p>

<p>As Doris entered she saw, or fancied she saw, that a
change had taken place even in the few hours since she
had last seen him; and his voice sounded to her weaker,
as, raising himself on his elbow, he stretched out his hand
toward her with feeble eagerness.</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you, my dear!” he said, his thin,
wasted fingers closing over her soft, warm ones. “This is
very good of you, very! And this, who is this?”</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Levant,” said Doris, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Mr. Levant,” he repeated, in quite a different voice.
“And who is——Ah, yes, I remember. I thank you
sir, for granting my request,” and he inclined his head to
Percy Levant with stately courtesy. “I wished to see you,
wished to see you very much. This young lady has been
very kind to the old and feeble man you see before you.
She has a gentle and a good heart, sir. And you are the
fortunate man who has won her, it would seem.”</p>

<p>“I deem myself very fortunate, my lord,” said Percy
Levant.</p>

<p>The keen, piercing eyes seemed to dart through him.</p>

<p>“That is the truth, if you never spoke it before,” he
retorted, in his old, cynical way. “Have I had the honor
of meeting you before, Mr. Levant?”</p>

<p>“Never that I am aware of, my lord,” said Percy Levant;
“and my acquaintances are so few that I am not
likely to have forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the old man, still eying him as if he were
trying to gain some glimpse of his character. “You are
ready with a repartee, I observe.”</p>

<p>“One need be who would hope to be worthy of crossing
swords with the Marquis of Stoyle.”</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes glittered.</p>

<p>“Good, good!” he said, in a low voice; then, to Doris,
whose hand he still held as she sat beside the couch:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
“You will have a clever man for a husband, my dear, and
that is better than having a fool.”</p>

<p>Doris hung her head.</p>

<p>“And you, sir, will have such a treasure as falls to the
lot of few mortals.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant, as he stood with folded arms, bowed
gravely.</p>

<p>“I am fully sensible of that, my lord.”</p>

<p>“You should be,” said the marquis.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence, during which his eyes
lost their keen expression and grew absent and dreamy.</p>

<p>“Marriages are made in heaven,” he said, as if to himself.
“Yes, in heaven. Do you know my nephew, Cecil
Neville?”</p>

<p>Doris sank lower into her chair, and averted her face.</p>

<p>“I have heard of him, my lord,” replied Percy Levant.</p>

<p>“Ah, no doubt! He is not clever, but he marries a
clever girl! Yes, Grace is clever,” and a smile curved his
thin lips. “Cecil gave us some trouble, but we were too
sharp for him. I think I told you, my dear?” he broke
off to ask of Doris.</p>

<p>She shook her head and tried to speak, to lead him
away from further mention of the name which struck her
heart, but with the persistence of old age he went on:</p>

<p>“It’s a curious story, Mr.——forgive me, sir, but I
have forgotten your name.”</p>

<p>“Percy Levant; but it is of no consequence, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Levant. A curious story. My
nephew, Cecil Neville, is the next in succession. He will
be the Marquis of Stoyle. We were never very friendly.
My fault, no doubt; I plead guilty, my dear,” to Doris.
“All old men in my position have plans, and I have one.
I wanted him to marry Peyton’s daughter Grace. You
see, Peyton and I were old friends, and Grace had a claim
upon me. I thought she would make a very good marchioness,
and a capital match for Cecil. I’m afraid I
weary you, sir,” he broke off.</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said Percy Levant, in a constrained
voice, and carefully avoiding looking in Doris’ direction.</p>

<p>“No? You are very good. Well, I wanted Cecil to
marry her. I expected some opposition, but, by gad, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
didn’t expect that he would thwart me to the extent of
falling in love—engaging himself to another girl!”</p>

<p>Doris, white and trembling, laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>“You—you will tire yourself, my lord,” she managed to
murmur.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said. “I want to tell you, my dear. It is
a very good story. Where was I——”</p>

<p>“Lord Cecil was in love with another lady, I believe,
my lord,” said Percy Levant, in a dry voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” murmured the marquis, feebly, “a young
person by the name of——” He stopped and knit his
brows. “I’m sorry, but I can’t remember her name!”</p>

<p>“It is of no consequence, my lord,” said Percy Levant,
still averting his eyes from the spot where Doris sat with
drooping head.</p>

<p>“I can’t remember her name. She was an actress. An
actress! Imagine it, my dear!” and he turned to Doris
with a smile. “A common actress to be the Marchioness
of Stoyle! I thought Cecil had gone out of his mind,
and that I could laugh him, or argue him out of his absurd
fancy; but sarcasm and logic were thrown away
upon him, and I admit that I should have been beaten,
yes, beaten!—I, who had never been thwarted in my life!—but,
fortunately, some one came to my aid.”</p>

<p>He stopped and dropped back upon the cushions; and
Doris, with an effort, rose and gave him some water.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear,” he said, gratefully, his eyes resting
on her pale face with an affectionate smile.</p>

<p>“Spenser Churchill——” Doris nearly let the glass
fall and sank back into her chair.</p>

<p>“Mr. Spenser Churchill, the great philanthropist, my
lord?” asked Percy Levant, in a dry voice.</p>

<p>The marquis laughed a sardonic laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, the great philanthropist! The man who takes
the chair at the great annual meetings; the man who
champions the cause of the widow and the orphans. Yes,
that is the man. Everybody knows Spenser Churchill.”
He stopped and smiled, as if he were reveling in some
memory connected with the name. “That is the man.
You know him?”</p>

<p>Percy Levant nodded.</p>

<p>“Every one knows him, my lord.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>“And believes in him! That’s an admirable joke!
Well, he came to my assistance. My nephew, Cecil, had
arranged to meet his ‘ladye love,’ this actress girl, or to
put a letter to her underneath a stone or in a hollow tree—the
usual thing, Mr.—Mr.——”</p>

<p>“Levant, my lord,” said Percy.</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you! Yes, Mr. Levant. And my
friend, Spenser Churchill, the great philanthropist, suggested
that I should send Cecil out of the way, and that
he, Spenser Churchill, should forge a letter from Cecil
dissolving the engagement, and place it in the hollow tree,
or whatever it was. I forget——” and he fell back,
struggling for breath.</p>

<p>Doris sat motionless as a statue, with her hands clasped
in her lap. Percy Levant bent over him and gave him
some water.</p>

<p>“It—it was dangerous work, for Cecil had not left for
Ireland, and—and if he had caught Spenser Churchill——”
He stopped and smiled significantly. “But I’ll
give Churchill his due. He risked the thing, and exchanged
the real letter for the forgery, and—<i>heigh,
presto!</i>—the engagement to this actress girl was done
away with. The simple girl fell into the pit Spenser
Churchill had dug for her, and”—he waved his thin,
white hand—“there was an end of her, thank Heaven!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Percy Levant, grimly, his eyes still fixed
on the white, wrinkled face; “and Lord Cecil, what of
him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll get over it in time,” said the marquis. “I
think he was hard hit. I remember when he came back
from Ireland he was rather cut up. I think so. My memory
is very bad. But he could not have felt it much, for
he proposed to Grace.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Spenser Churchill—did he have anything to
do with this engagement, my lord?”</p>

<p>The marquis thought for a moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but I expect he had. Oh, yes, he must
have had, for I promised to give him a couple of thousand
pounds the day Cecil and Grace were married and I daresay
he did his best to earn it. Trust Spenser Churchill
for that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. And Lord Cecil and Lady Grace Peyton—are
they married yet?” asked Percy Levant.</p>

<p>The marquis shook his head.</p>

<p>“No; they are waiting until I get better, and I am getting
better! I shall be quite well directly; and, my dear,
an idea has just struck me. You shall be one of Grace’s
bridesmaids!”</p>

<p>Doris started, and shrank back speechlessly. Suddenly
she felt Percy Levant’s hand upon her arm.</p>

<p>“Say ‘Yes,’” he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I—I cannot!” she almost moaned.</p>

<p>Percy Levant looked at her; then he took her hand in
his, and held it for a moment.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said, and dropped it gently. “Your
lordship is very kind,” he said; “but Miss Marlowe is going
to be married very soon, and, probably, before Lord
Cecil. You have not told us the name of the young lady
whose engagement to Lord Cecil was so cleverly broken
off by Mr. Spenser Churchill. What was it?”</p>

<p>Doris rose, pale as a ghost, and caught Percy Levant’s
arm.</p>

<p>“No, no!” she breathed. “No! Do not ask him that!”</p>

<p>The marquis knit his brows.</p>

<p>“Her name?” he said, in a low voice and with a bewildered
air. “I—I can’t remember. I am an old man,
you see, sir, and—and—her name? What was it?”</p>

<p>Doris, drooping like a lily bent by the storm, clung to
Percy Levant’s arm.</p>

<p>“No, you shall not ask him,” she panted.</p>

<p>Slowly, painfully, he removed her fingers from his arm.</p>

<p>“There is no need,” he said, inaudibly to the marquis;
“you have told me already. Her name was Doris Marlowe!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“I, TOO, AM FREE.”</p>


<p>“No need to tell me,” said Percy Levant in a voice
inaudible to the marquis. “I know!”</p>

<p>Doris sank back into her chair and covered her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
with her hands. The marquis leaned forward, regarding
her with alarm.</p>

<p>“What is it? What is the matter?” he inquired,
agitatedly. “What have I said——” He broke down
and began to cough and tremble, and the valet hurried
to his side; but the old man waved him away with feeble
savageness.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with her?” he demanded of Percy
Levant as imperiously as his weak voice would let him.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe is not strong, and the heat of the
room——Come, Doris,” he broke off more gently, and
he drew her hand through his arm.</p>

<p>She was going with a glance—a glance of reproach—at
the thin, wrinkled face; then her heart seemed to yearn,
and she touched the wasted hand stretched out to her.</p>

<p>“Heaven forgive you, my lord!” she murmured, with
infinite sadness, and allowed Percy Levant to lead her
away.</p>

<p>The marquis almost rose in his alarm and anxiety.</p>

<p>“Where are you going? What have I said? Come
back——” Then he fell on his side gasping for breath,
and the terrified valet sprang to the bell and sent for
the doctor.</p>

<p>Doris walked home in a state of mind easy enough to
imagine but very difficult to describe. Imagine the emotion
of a tender-hearted woman who for many weary
months has deemed the man she loved with all her pure,
ardent nature false, and then suddenly discovering that
she has misjudged and wrongfully condemned him!</p>

<p>The sudden shock of joy that ran through her almost
seemed to deprive her of her senses, and it was with the
greatest difficulty that she could refrain from crying
aloud, “Oh, my love! my love! forgive me! forgive me!”
And if she did not say it aloud, the prayer rose from her
heart. The cruel letter, which she read and re-read daily
in the hope that its perusal would crush out her love for
him, was false! A fiend in the form of a man had betrayed
them both, and Cecil was true! He had loved
her—loved her, Doris, until he had received that letter
which she had given to Spenser Churchill—had loved her
and deemed her as false as she had thought him!</p>

<p>For a time her mind failed to realize the web and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
woof of the plot which the “philanthropist” had woven
with such devilish cunning; but though she did not know
all the threads and lines of the scheme, she gradually
began to understand how completely she and Cecil had
been deceived. But why? What was the motive? She
put the question away from her, and returned to the
delicious thought that, after all, he, Cecil, had not deserted
her; that the wicked letter was a forgery; and
that her faith in him was restored to her.</p>

<p>And Percy Levant watched by her side, tenderly supporting
her trembling arm in silence. Love bestows a
keen insight into the feelings of the one beloved, and he
knew all that was passing through her mind, and read it
as one reads a printed book, and—he kept silence.</p>

<p>They reached the villa, and he led her into the hall.</p>

<p>“Go up to your room and rest,” he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, with a little start, as if she had forgotten
his presence. “Yes, I—I am tired—very, very
tired!” and she pressed her hand over her heart.</p>

<p>“Rest,” he repeated. “I shall remain in the house
in case you should want me,” and he dropped her hand,
and, strolling into the drawing-room, walked to the window,
and looked out with the face of a man who has received
sentence of death, and to whom all mundane matters
can be of no consequence whatever.</p>

<p>Doris went upstairs to her own room slowly, and sank
into a chair.</p>

<p>“Cecil was true! Cecil was true! Cecil loved me!”
she repeated to herself a hundred times; then suddenly
she started, for on a chair opposite her she caught sight
of her wedding dress.</p>

<p>It was as if a ghost had suddenly risen to dispel her
newly recovered joy and happiness with a word, a
breath.</p>

<p>Cecil had been true, yes, but he was engaged to Lady
Grace, and she, Doris, was within a few days of her marriage
with Percy Levant.</p>

<p>The sudden revulsion of feeling sent the blood from
her cheeks, and made her blind and dizzy, and she
stretched out her hands as if to push some terrible phantom
from her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>So she sat for a full minute; then her brain cleared,
and she saw the situation distinctly and plainly.</p>

<p>She had regained her faith in her lover, but—it was too
late to save her! After all, Spenser Churchill had
effected his purpose, whatever it was, for Lord Cecil
Neville was almost wedded to Lady Grace, and she——!
She uttered a cry, almost a sob, as she thought of the
man who was waiting for her downstairs.</p>

<p>If Lord Cecil had loved her, so had Percy Levant, and
with a love as strong, and as true! Could she desert
him? If so, then she would prove herself as false as
she had deemed Cecil Neville, who could be nothing to
her now, for was he not to marry Lady Grace? He had
forgotten her, Doris, by this time, and even if he had
not, her word was pledged to the other man who loved
her so devotedly! What should she do? She fell on
her knees and hid her face in her hands, and in that attitude
of despairing supplication remained for half-an-hour.</p>

<p>Then she rose, and, bathing her burning eyes, went
slowly downstairs. He was there, standing at the window,
and he came to meet her with a haggard face, which
told of the agony the intense suffering of waiting had cost
him.</p>

<p>“Are you—are you rested?” he said, in a low voice,
and he took her hand and led her to a couch. “I waited
because I thought you would like to say ‘good-by.’”</p>

<p>She just raised her heavy lids, then clasped her hands
in her lap and waited for him to go on.</p>

<p>“I am going. Of course, you know that. My love for
you has not yet robbed me of all manliness, Doris, and—I
am going. This discovery which you made this afternoon
was half-suspected by me. The eyes of a man who
loves are keen in all matters pertaining to the woman
he loves, and from certain signs I suspected that Lord
Cecil Neville was bound up in your past life; but it was
suspicion only. The marquis’ innocent exposure has
turned it into certainty. And so—I have waited to bid
you good-by.”</p>

<p>She sat perfectly motionless for a moment. Then she
looked up at him, with a piteous entreaty.</p>

<p>“What shall I say?” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Say nothing,” he replied, huskily. “I give you your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
freedom, Miss Marlowe. Knowing, as I do, how cruelly
you have been deceived—you and Lord Cecil,” he put
in, as if the speaking of his name were difficult to him,
“there is no other course open to me. I love you—ah,
yes!—you know that; but my very love for you pleads
for you against myself! And so I give you back all
your pledges, and say simply, ‘good-by!’”</p>

<p>He held out his hand, eying her keenly and sorrowfully.
But she did not place her burning hand in his.
Instead, she shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>“Stay,” she murmured, almost inaudibly, and her pale
face grew crimson for a second.</p>

<p>He leaned upon the couch, and bent over her, trembling,
and white as death.</p>

<p>“You say ‘Stay!’” he breathed. “Think—think what
the word means to me, Doris!”</p>

<p>“I—I have thought!” she breathed.</p>

<p>“It means—ah, you cannot imagine all it means to
me! Will you repeat it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, in as low a voice as before.</p>

<p>He took her hand and held it in his.</p>

<p>“And will you tell me that—that you do not love Lord
Cecil; that you can forget him?”</p>

<p>She turned her face away.</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t drive me too hard!” she murmured,
piteously.</p>

<p>His face grew wan and haggard again.</p>

<p>“I—I understand,” he said. “Yes, I understand—and
I must be content.”</p>

<p>He let her hand fall, and walked to the window, turning
his back to her. Then he returned, and kneeling
beside her, said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>“Doris, I asked you to trust me. I ask it still. Remember
that no man, not even Lord Cecil”—with a
touch of bitterness—“could love you more dearly than I
love you; and—trust me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I trust you! I have always done so,” she said,
almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>“We are to be married on the sixteenth,” he said,
musingly. “Everything is ready, Doris.”</p>

<p>She inclined her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>“We will be married on the sixteenth!” he said, almost
solemnly. He raised her hand to his lips. “Don’t look
so scared, Doris,” he said, with a curious smile. “I—I
am a better man than you think me!” and, dropping her
hand, he left the room.</p>

<p>Doris had burned her boats. There was no returning
across the river. She had pledged herself now irrevocably.</p>

<p>The next morning at breakfast the marquis’ valet
called to inquire after Miss Marlowe.</p>

<p>“His lordship has been in a terrible state, miss,” he
said, gravely. “He was afraid that something he had
said had offended or alarmed you, and although he was
put at a loss to remember what it was, the idea distressed
him very much, and seems to be preying on his mind.
He was very ill, indeed, last night, quite wandering, so
to speak, and the doctor did not leave him for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Please tell the marquis that I—I have forgiven all
that he said, that I know he was not aware there was
anything to offend me in—in the incident he related,”
said Doris, painfully. “Yes; tell him that whatever it
was, I forgive it freely.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, miss,” said the valet, with a look of relief.
“His lordship will be very glad to get the message.
Begging your pardon, miss, but his lordship seems, if I
may be so bold, to be wrapped up in you. He was
talking about her ladyship, the marchioness, last night,
her ladyship and the little girl, and he kept repeating
your name, as if you reminded him of her.”</p>

<p>Doris sighed. Percy Levant stood gravely regarding
the tablecloth, saying not a word.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have sent for Lord Cecil as the marquis
is so much worse?” said Lady Despard.</p>

<p>The valet shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I certainly intended doing so as soon as the telegraph
office was open this morning, my lady; but directly the
marquis became conscious he distinctly forbade me doing
so. Of course, I should not disobey him while he was
sensible, and there was no immediate danger. The marquis
demands implicit obedience from his household, my
lady.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Miss Marlowe will be able to call and see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
him this morning,” said Lady Despard, glancing inquiringly
at Doris; but Doris grew pale, and shook her head.</p>

<p>“Not to-day,” she said, in a low voice, and almost
pleadingly. “To-morrow—perhaps.”</p>

<p>The valet bowed.</p>

<p>“Thank you, miss,” he said, gratefully, and as he withdrew
he added, respectfully, “a sight of you will do him
more good than all the doctors in Italy, I am sure, miss.”</p>

<p>If Doris had promised to pay the sick man a visit she
could not have done so, for Percy Levant, without consulting
either of the ladies, ordered the phaeton and pair
and calmly requested them to get their things on.</p>

<p>“I am going to take you ladies for a long drive,” he
said, with that air of resolution which all women admire
in a man. “You, Doris, because you need it for your
health’s sake, and you, Lady Despard, because you are
in danger of becoming a monomaniac!”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” retorted Lady Despard, languidly; “and
what’s my mania, pray?”</p>

<p>“Wedding millinery,” he replied, pointing to the confused
mass of lace and muslin amid which Lady Despard
seemed to exist.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s some truth in that,” she said, with a
smile; “and, anyway, I suppose we shall have to go, eh,
Doris? And this is the man whom we thought all milk
and honey, so meek and docile as scarcely to have a
will of his own!” she added, pouting. “You see what
you have done, my dear; you have completely spoiled
him by being foolish enough to promise to marry him!”</p>

<p>She went for the drive, Percy Levant taking the reins
and Doris seated beside him, and in after years she remembered,
with a singular vividness, every incident of
the day, almost every word he spoke. Never had he
been in lighter humor, or in better “form;” and if his
object was to drive, for the time at least, all remembrance
of the marquis and his story of Spenser Churchill’s villainy
from her mind, he almost succeeded, and as the
hours sped by, the exquisite scenery, the keen, fresh air,
and the unflagging wit and humor of her companion
brought the color to Doris’ pale cheeks, and drove the
lines of care and trouble from her brow.</p>

<p>And through it all he permitted no sign of his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
suffering to become visible. The handsome face was
serenely cheerful, the pliant lips wore a settled smile,
causing Lady Despard to look at him once, and exclaim,
with a sigh:</p>

<p>“I wish you could sell me that butterfly nature and
disposition of yours, Percy. I would give you more
than half my kingdom.”</p>

<p>“Would you?” he said, turning on the box and glancing
at Doris as he did so. “Would you?” and a curious
expression flashed across his face for a moment. “I’m
afraid you would be like the man who thought he was
doing a clever thing in buying a sovereign for nineteen
shillings and sixpence until he tried to change the coin
and discovered that it was—a counterfeit!”</p>

<p>They went to a country inn, at which he had ordered
dinner by a servant sent on before, and Lady Despard
was enchanted by the dainty simplicity of the menu and
the manner in which he played the host, and when he
strolled off to smoke his cigar and leave them to trifle
with the grapes and the ripe figs which nestled in the
center of a huge <i>repousse</i> dish of such flowers as only
Italy can produce, Lady Despard patted Doris on the
cheek, causing her to start from a reverie, and said:</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, I will say it again: You have done very
well! He will be simply a treasure of a husband. I
assure you, I don’t know another man in all my extensive
list of friends and acquaintances who could have behaved
so perfectly. Fancy taking two women out for the day,
keeping them amused every minute, and then giving
them all the nice things women love, not ugly chops and
steaks, but all these delicate things for dinner. And he’ll
be just as fresh and bright all the way home, of course!
Yes, I must repeat it, my dear. I think you have made
an excellent choice, and if I hadn’t registered a vow
never to marry again, why—oh, there’s time to cut you
out yet if I tried very hard, so don’t look so exasperatingly
self-confident! And now the best thing you can
do,” she went on, as Doris smiled and sighed, “is to go
and find him, and repay him for all his trouble with one
of those sweet, little speeches of yours, and several of
those upward glances of those blue eyes which seem so
innocent and commonplace, and yet, as I have been told,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
drive poor men to thoughts of suicide. Go and find him,
my dear; he hasn’t gone far, and is, of course, waiting
for you to join him. I shall be quite happy and content
for an hour, I assure you. Come back when the moon is
up above those trees, and then we will start.”</p>

<p>“Which means that you want to go to sleep,” said
Doris, smiling as she rose.</p>

<p>“Quite right, dear,” assented Lady Despard, serenely.
“I want to go to sleep for a few minutes, and dream
that I, too, have got a handsome young man who is fortunately
poor enough to have to work for me, and who
worships the ground I tread on. Go and find him, and—be
good to him, for he deserves it!”</p>

<p>Doris went slowly in the direction Percy Levant had
taken, but she did not see him, and presently, losing herself
in her thoughts, she wandered across the lawn which
stretched between the inn and the high road, and, leaning
against the low wall, gave herself to brooding over the
confession which the marquis had made—if confession it
could be called!</p>

<p>Presently she was startled by the sound of wheels coming
down the steep road to her right, and a few minutes
afterward she saw a traveling carriage pull up at the
door of the inn, amidst a great bustle and confusion, the
stamping of horses’ hoofs, the click of changing harness,
and the shouting of outriders.</p>

<p>Then she heard voices asking and answering questions,
and among them the landlord’s suave tones, begging
some one—the travelers, presumably—to enter and rest
themselves while the horses were fed.</p>

<p>Doris listened in an absent kind of fashion, in which
the noises and voices came to her like those in a dream,
until, suddenly looking up, she saw the moon had risen
above the tree tops, and she turned to go back to the arbor
in which Lady Despard was doubtless sleeping the
sleep of the just. As she did so, she heard a slow step at
her side, and glancing in its direction, saw a tall figure
coming toward her with a slow and listless step. She
was drawing back into the shadow of the shrubs to let
him pass without seeing her, when suddenly the moon
smiled from behind a cloud, and poured its light full on
his face, and she saw that it was Lord Cecil Neville!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span></p>

<p>Yes, it was his face, but how altered! Pale and haggard
it looked, as if as many years as minutes had passed
over it since she saw it last in all its bright, fresh youthfulness,
and it was the shock caused by this change in the
beloved face, as much as the sudden appearance which
kept her rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>She could not have moved if her life had depended on
it, and he was almost upon her before he noticed her.
Then, raising his hat, he murmured:</p>

<p>“Pardon, senorita,” and was going on, when, looking
more closely at her, he uttered an exclamation, and stood
like herself, stock-still.</p>

<p>For a space in which one could count twenty, these two
stood looking into each other’s eyes speechless, then he
said:</p>

<p>“Doris!” and stretching out his arms, made a step
toward her.</p>

<p>For a second the desire to sink upon his breast was terrible,
but she fought against it and shrank back.</p>

<p>The color which had rushed to his face as he spoke her
name died away at her gesture of repudiation, and letting
his arms drop to his side, he said in a constrained voice:</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe! Am I dreaming? Doris, is it you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is I,” she said, almost inaudibly, her heart
beating so loudly in her ears as almost to drown her
voice.</p>

<p>“You! You!” he repeated, looking round as if he could
not believe the evidence of his senses. “You, and here!
Good Heavens, I thought I was dreaming!” he muttered.
“I—I thought you were—when did you come here?” he
broke off as if he scarcely knew what he was saying; his
eyes devouring her face with the expression in them
which might shine in the eyes of a man who, dying of
thirst, sees the limpid stream—just beyond his reach.</p>

<p>“I—I came here, to Italy, some months ago, my lord,”
she said, and her voice sounded strange and hollow.</p>

<p>“Some months, some months?” he repeated, putting his
hand to his head and pushing the hair from his forehead;
a trick which Doris remembered with a vividness which
was like a stab.</p>

<p>“Why, how could that be? You could not get back
from Australia—and yet, yes, I suppose so!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>She started and looked at him, and was about to exclaim,
“Australia? I have never been there, my lord!”
when she thought it better to remain silent, remembering
the marquis’ story.</p>

<p>“You—you did not stay long,” he said. “Were you,
are you happy?” he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>She turned her head away; her lips quivering at the
dull accents of pain in his voice.</p>

<p>“Few mortals are happy, my lord,” she replied, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>He waved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake don’t address me as if we were
strangers!” he broke out. “It is a farce in which I find it
impossible to play! Doris——” he stopped and drew
nearer to her—“are you so hard of heart, or so light of
memory, that you can forget, absolutely forget, all that
passed between us—you and I? Have you forgotten
Barton meadows? The day I fell off the horse at your
feet? the day I told you that I loved you, and asked you
to be my wife? the day you promised to be my wife?”</p>

<p>She shrank back against the wall, and put her hands
against it as if to sustain her and keep her from falling.</p>

<p>“Have you clean forgotten?” he demanded, bitterly.</p>

<p>“I have tried to forget,” she panted.</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven!” he exclaimed, with suppressed passion;
“and they say women have hearts, they boast that women
are gentle and merciful! You tried to forget; and, of
course, you succeeded! While I——” he drew near to
her and looked longingly at her pale face, all the lovelier
for its pallor and the intense light shining in the beautiful
eyes, the tremor on the perfectly curved lips; “while I
have thought of you day by day, night by night! I swear
that there is not a night in which I have not dreamed of
you, in which you have not stood beside me to mock me
with those eyes of yours, to murmur the vows which fell
so readily from those sweet lips. Great Heavens, how
cruel, how merciless even the best of you can be!”</p>

<p>In the fury of his agony it almost seemed as if he were
about to strike her with his upraised hand, and Doris felt
a wild thrill run through her as the conviction that he
still loved her forced itself upon her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>

<p>“He loves me still! He loves me still!” she almost
cried aloud.</p>

<p>“Yes, the best of you,” he repeated, dully, like a man
whose senses are half numbed with pain. “For I counted
you the best, and—Heaven help me!—I still count you so!
Doris—I don’t know by what name I should call you,
but till I die you will be ‘Doris’ to me—Doris, why did
you deceive me? I have lain awake at nights trying to
answer that question. I ask you to tell me now, now that
all is over between us——” and he bit his lips till the
blood came as he gazed at the lovely, downcast face. “All
is over, and we are miles apart, worlds apart,” and he
stifled a groan, “and you can tell me safely. Why did
you treat me as you did? Was it simply deviltry, coquetry,
what? What fun, amusement, was there in it?
They said you were practising your profession upon me;
that I was a mere block, which you were acting—always
acting—up to. Was that true?”</p>

<p>She made no reply, but stood statue-like, her hands
pressed against the rough wall, her heart beating in dull,
heavy throbs which seemed to stifle her.</p>

<p>“Was it true? If so, then you were the wickedest, the
cruelest woman God ever made!” he said, fiercely.
“There are some women whose trade it is—professed
flirts—to fool and betray men; but they carry the sign of
their trade on faces and voices, and we men are aware of
them. But you—you, with that innocent face of yours,
with that sweet, girlish voice of yours, with those eyes
whose truth a man might stake his soul upon——” he
stopped and gazed at her as if his soul were slipping from
him. “Why don’t you answer me?” he broke off, almost
savagely.</p>

<p>Her dry lips quivered, a longing so intense as to be
almost irresistible assailed her; the desire to exclaim: “I
did not deceive you; I did love you; I still love you. No
treachery of mine parted us!” but she remembered the
promise she had made to Percy Levant, the promise renewed
only that morning; remembered that he, Lord Cecil,
was either already married, or pledged to marry Lady
Grace, and she remained silent.</p>

<p>He drew a long breath and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You can’t answer. I suppose it was merely for amusement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
that you led me on to loving you, merely for amusement
that you got the heart out of my bosom, merely for
amusement that you promised to be my wife, and still
merely for amusement—broke my heart!”</p>

<p>She turned. They say the worm will turn if trodden
on too persistently.</p>

<p>“Was it only a broken heart you offered to Lady Grace,
my lord?” she said. The moment after she had spoken
the words she would have recalled them, for she saw
by the sudden pallor of his face, the quiver of his lips,
how much they had cost him.</p>

<p>“I see,” he said, in a low voice; “you seek to excuse
yourself of unfaithfulness by accusing me!”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she breathed; but he went on, disregarding
her.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am engaged to Lady Grace! It is quite true.
All the world knows it,” with a suppressed bitterness;
“but I did not ask her to be my wife until you had—jilted—me!
Jilted! It is too light a word. Men use
it as a jest. But you did not jilt, you deserted and betrayed
me!”</p>

<p>“I—I!” she panted.</p>

<p>“Yes!” he said, passionately. “You waited until I had
left England—left England to please and conciliate my
uncle—and then, disregarding my letters, my appeals to
your love and your honor, you coldly—like a finished coquette!—cast
me off with a few cold words. Good
Heavens, I cannot recall it without feeling the old pain,
the old madness!” he broke off. “Oh, Doris, you have
broken other hearts than mine, I dare say, but you never
broke one that loved you half as dearly, half as truly, as
mine did! I would have staked my life, my honor, on
your truthfulness. I would have upheld it in the face of
the whole world, and,” with a bitter smile, “should have
been rightly laughed at for my pains! Doris, the treachery
that was sport to you, was death to me! Look at
me!” he drew nearer to her, and folded his arms. “That
day I lay with my head in your lap I was a young man,
with all a young man’s keen zest for life, with all a young
man’s keen desire for life and belief in happiness! I feel
like an old man now, bereft of all hope, haunted by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
memory of your deceit. This is your work! Be proud
of it, if you can!”</p>

<p>She hid her face in her hands, lest it should tell him
too much, and he mistook the gesture and attitude for a
confession of her guilt, and it moved him to a softer
mood.</p>

<p>“I—I beg your pardon,” he stammered. “Don’t—for
Heaven’s sake—don’t cry! That won’t do any good.
I’m awfully sorry I should have blared out what I felt.
It’s—it’s all past and gone now. Of course, you are married?”</p>

<p>Her lips formed the word “no,” though it was not
audible.</p>

<p>“No!” he exclaimed, and the blood rushed to his face.
“Not married! Then you are still Doris Marlowe, still
Doris—the Doris I think and dream of——” He laid his
hand on the wall and bent over her, trembling visibly.
“Not married! Why—why—I don’t understand! I
thought—that is—Doris——” a strange change in his
voice smote upon her ears suddenly, a tone of wild, mad
hope. “Doris, I thought you were utterly lost to me!
That you were married! Why have you not married?”</p>

<p>She remained silent, and the color came and went on
his face, and his eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“Why, Doris? You must answer me! Is it because—ah,
no! you can’t have remembered—and yet——You
are still Doris Marlowe! The dear, sweet Doris who won
my heart in Barton meadows! Doris—you—you—drive
me almost mad! The mere sight of you wipes out all the
weary months since we parted! You are free still? Free?
By Heaven, I can scarcely believe it!” He drew nearer,
panting heavily, like a man who suddenly dares entertain
the hope that dawns upon him. “Not married! Doris,
do you remember? Let me look at your face! Why
do you turn away from me? Are you playing with me
still? If you are not married, there must be some reason!
Great Heavens! don’t deceive, don’t betray me now!
Listen! I, too, am free! I will be free! I’d give up all
the world for your sake! Doris, listen to me! It may
not be—it may not be too late!”</p>

<p>He was bending over her so closely now that she could
feel his breath upon her cheek; an awful, a terrible languor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
was creeping over her; if he had caught her in his
arms, and touched her lips with his, she could not have
resisted. Love, the all-powerful god, was pleading with
her for this, the only man she had ever loved, and she was
conscious that she was yielding—yielding.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Doris; tell me again!” he exclaimed, passionately.
“It may not be too late! You are not married;
and I thought—they told me——My darling, my
love, my Doris——”</p>

<p>His hand was upon her arm, his lips close to her face,
his breath stirred her hair; she felt powerless to move;
in another moment she would, by no consent of her own,
have been in his arms, when, suddenly, she felt herself
drawn from him, and a voice said, in calm, clear accents:</p>

<p>“Lord Cecil Neville, I believe?”</p>

<p>Cecil drew himself up to his full height.</p>

<p>“My name is Neville,” he said, haughtily.</p>

<p>Percy Levant slowly and gently drew Doris’ arm within
his.</p>

<p>“So I imagined, my lord,” he said, not sternly nor
haughtily, but with a calm—almost judicial—gravity. “I
could have wished that our meeting could have been under
freer circumstances,” and he nodded significantly; “but as
it is, allow me to introduce myself! My name is Levant—Percy
Levant!”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil gave the short, military bow which is half
a nod and half an obeisance, and glanced at Doris, who
leaned upon Percy Levant’s arm, and hung her head; her
quivering lips and pallid face bearing evidence to the
emotions which wrung her heart.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am Cecil Neville,” said Lord Cecil. “I am an
old—” he paused—“an old friend of Miss Marlowe’s,
whom I did not expect to meet here. You are a relation,
I presume?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Percy Levant, meeting the half-fierce gaze
of the dark Stoyle eyes. “But I hope to be. I have the
happiness and honor to be Miss Marlowe’s affianced husband.”</p>

<p>Cecil Neville drew back a step, and his face grew
white.</p>

<p>“I—I beg your pardon,” he said, stiffly. “I—I did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
know. Why did you not tell me?” he asked, turning to
Doris with white lips and reproachful eyes.</p>

<p>She tried to speak, had opened her lips, indeed, when a
voice, impatient and querulous, broke the silence. It was
the voice of Lady Grace.</p>

<p>“Cecil! Cecil!” she called. “Where are you? Ce—cil!
Ce—cil!”</p>

<p>His face reddened.</p>

<p>“I am going to Pescia to visit a sick relative,” he said,
addressing Percy Levant, in a low voice. “You will be
able to find me at the hotel, if you should require me,” he
added, significantly.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my lord,” said Percy Levant, as significantly.</p>

<p>“Ce—cil!” called the voice again.</p>

<p>He bit his lip, and, without another word, turned and
left them; but as he passed out of the walk, illumined by
the bright rays of the moon, he stopped, and looked back,
as Adam might have looked back upon the Paradise he
had left forever, as one might have looked for the last
time upon a treasure utterly and entirely lost.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil walked toward the carriage, in which Lady
Grace and the marquis’ lady housekeeper were sitting,
and Lady Grace, leaning through the window, greeted
him with a smiling, but scarcely concealed impatience.
She was dressed in a traveling costume of Redfern’s,
which must have astonished the intelligent foreigner
pretty considerably, and looked, for all her famous loveliness,
rather tired, worn and ill at ease.</p>

<p>“Why, Cecil, where have you been?” she exclaimed;
“I have been calling for the last half-hour.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely as long as that, Grace,” he said, and his voice
sounded hoarse and strained. “I have only been a few
yards away, and heard you.”</p>

<p>“At least, then, you might have answered,” she retorted.
“Do you know how long we are to wait here?”</p>

<p>“Not much longer,” he replied, leaning against the
carriage, and averting his face from the gaze of her sharp,
keen eyes. “Horses are not machines, you must remember,
and want rest sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Horses, I don’t call them horses,” she said, contemptuously;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
“they are living skeletons. I am so tired of sitting
here!”</p>

<p>“Will you come inside the inn?” he asked, with a barely
concealed weariness.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thanks. I know what that means. These
inns are a disgrace to any civilized country. What with
the smell of garlic and the dreadful men hanging about
them, they are too awful. If you could get me a glass of
wine, of decent wine, dear——”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, and went into the inn. “Give me
a bottle of the best wine you have got, and a glass of
brandy,” he said to the landlord, and he drank the latter
almost at a draught, his hand shaking as he carried the
glass to his lips. If he had seen a ghost instead of sweet
Doris Marlowe, he could not have been more completely
unmanned and upset. Indeed, he had seen a ghost; the
ghost of his lost happiness and wrecked life, and she was
to marry this stranger, this Percy Levant; what had become
of the Mr. Garland, with whom she had sailed to
Australia, then? He was so lost in troubled reverie that
he had quite forgotten Lady Grace, until the familiar, too
familiar, “Ce—cil,” issuing from the carriage, recalled his
wandering mind.</p>

<p>He caught up the wine bottle and a glass and strode
back to the carriage, filled with that weariness and despair
which renders every moment of existence almost unendurable
to the galley slave and convict. At that moment
he would have given half a continent, had he possessed
it, to be alone and free to indulge in his sad and
bitter reflections.</p>

<p>Unknown to the valet, the Pescia doctor had telegraphed
to him a few days ago, and he had told Lady
Grace that he must start for Italy, and at once. Much to
his surprise, to his embarrassment, also, she had declared
her intention of accompanying him. The fact must be
stated, alas! that Lady Grace could not endure her lover’s
absence from her side, even for a few days. Her love
for him—her passion, as it must be called—had become
the absorbing sentiment of her life, and, like all absorbing
emotions, it tortured her. She knew, knew for a certainty,
that he did not love her, and all her days and
nights were filled by a devouring jealousy and discontent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
She was rendered wretched if he spoke to or danced with
a young and pretty girl. She was jealous of his past as a
whole, but madly, fiercely jealous of the girl Doris Marlowe,
from whom she had, by the assistance of Spenser
Churchill, succeeded in separating him.</p>

<p>She knew he did not love her; that she had entrapped
him into the engagement, and she dreaded with an agony
of apprehension lest anything should occur to separate
them. It is not too much to say that she hated the marquis
for being ill and causing the postponement of her
marriage. A woman, when she knows that love is returned,
is full of trust and confidence, but Lady Grace,
knowing that Cecil bore her no love, was full of distrust
and suspicion, doubt, and fear. She was never happy,
nor at ease, unless he was in her sight, and she found it
simply impossible to allow him to go to Italy without her.
Sometimes, in the dead of night, she would awake with a
start and a cry of terror from a nightmare in which she
had dreamed that he had discovered her share in the plot
which had robbed him of Doris and bound him to herself,
and by day she lived in a constant dread that some accident
would reveal the conspiracy and deprive her of him.</p>

<p>So intense an anxiety began to tell upon her, and already
there were lines and wrinkles on the face which
artists had painted and of which poets had sung.</p>

<p>To put it briefly, Lady Grace’s punishment had commenced
even in the first hour of her triumph! Black care
sits behind every sorrow, but he is never more safely
seated than when he rides behind the man or woman
whose success depends upon a lie.</p>

<p>She knew that the world would talk and shrug its
shoulders if she accompanied Lord Cecil to Italy, although
she took the elderly lady as a <i>chaperone</i>; but she
set the world’s opinion at naught, just as she had done
when, in obedience to Spenser Churchill’s prompting, she
went down to Lord Cecil’s chambers. She could not let
him out of her sight, and that was the long and short of
it.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil took the wine to the carriage, and poured
some out for her, but she only put her lips to it.</p>

<p>“It is too awful!” she said, irritably. “Pray hurry them
on, Cecil. I am sure those horses must be rested by now.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
It is sheer laziness. Who was that you were talking to
when I called you?” she asked, abruptly, her keen eyes
fixed on his face.</p>

<p>He felt himself growing white.</p>

<p>“Nobody you know,” he said, abruptly. “Try and
drink some wine, it is not so bad.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure I don’t know them? I thought I heard
English voices.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know them,” he said, almost curtly.</p>

<p>“Let me out and let me see,” she said, querulously. “I
am sick of being cooped up here.”</p>

<p>“Come out by all means, if you like, Grace,” he responded,
“but there is no one there, and the horses are
just being put to.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the postilion led the weary animals into
the shafts, and Lady Grace sank back with a restless sigh.</p>

<p>“We shall find the marquis dead,” she said, callously.
“We seem to have been years on the journey; yes, he’ll
be dead!”</p>

<p>“I trust not,” he responded, grimly. “I’ll ride outside
and smoke a cigar,” he added, as the postboy smacked his
whip.</p>

<p>She flung herself back among the cushions.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” she said, petulantly.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil got on the box, and the carriage rolled onward
to Pescia and the Fate awaiting them.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE APPROACH OF THE SHADOW.</p>


<p>Heaven only knows what complexion Cecil’s thoughts
took during the journey, but he was graver and grimmer
than ever when he got down at the door of the villa to
help his affianced bride to alight.</p>

<p>The marquis’ valet received them with surprise, tempered
by satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I am glad you have come, my lord, though I did not
like to take the responsibility of wiring for you. The
marquis is much worse. Oh, yes, decidedly much worse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
He is asleep just now, but it is quite as well that you
came.”</p>

<p>“I will see him at once,” said Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“And I, too,” said Lady Grace, slipping her arm within
his.</p>

<p>The valet led the way upstairs.</p>

<p>The old man was lying apparently asleep, but as Lord
Cecil bent over him he opened his eyes, and after a few
seconds said, in a feeble voice and with the old cynical
smile:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, Cecil, is it? And is that you, my dear?”
turning his eyes in the direction of Lady Grace.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is I, dear marquis,” she murmured.</p>

<p>He started.</p>

<p>“Oh, Grace, is it?” he mumbled. “I thought it was
she.”</p>

<p>“She? Who, dear marquis?” she demanded.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“No matter. And so they have sent for you, have
they? They think I am in danger. You have come on a
fool’s errand, both of you. I”—grimly—“I don’t mean
to die yet, Grace.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not! Pray, don’t talk of anything so
dreadful,” she responded with a false smile. “Why, you
know,” and she bent lower, with a fine affectation of modesty,
“you are to dance at our—our—wedding, dear marquis.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!” he said, wearily, and with none of the enthusiasm
she had expected. “Yes, yes, of course. You
are going to be married; you and Cecil. Yes, I remember.
I’ll make haste and get better. In a day or two——” his
eyes closed and he turned his face away.</p>

<p>“He may last for weeks, months, even years, my lady,”
said the doctor, of whom Lady Grace made inquiries with
a scarcely concealed impatience. “Marvelous constitution,
you see, and with care——” and he waved his hands
deferentially.</p>

<p>The days passed in what her ladyship declared to be a
tediousness almost insupportable. She had the best rooms
of the best hotel, but they were not grand enough for her
fine London taste, and, as for the scenery, Lady Grace
would have exchanged the whole Alpine range for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
quarter of a mile of Hyde Park. She would have been
happy enough if Cecil could have spent every minute of
his time with her, but this Cecil could not do. In his
present condition of mind, the society of his engaged wife
nearly drove him mad, and he spent most of his time
either beside the marquis’ bed or at the villa.</p>

<p>“Surely you do not intend to play the part of sick
nurse, my dear Cecil!” Lady Grace remonstrated when,
on the third morning after their arrival, he told her that
he could not go out riding with her, because he had promised
to sit with the marquis.</p>

<p>“Not exactly that, Grace,” he replied, quietly. “But I
am naturally anxious about him and wish to be with him,
more especially as, strange to say, he seems to desire my
presence.”</p>

<p>“He must have changed to an extraordinary extent!”
she retorted, with something like a sneer on her exquisitely
carved lips.</p>

<p>Cecil nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he assented, simply. “He has changed—for the
better. I suppose we shall all feel the approach of the
Great Shadow! Poor old man!”</p>

<p>She stared at him, then laughed, a cold laugh of amusement,
almost of mockery.</p>

<p>“Really, you are the most forgiving of men, Cecil!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” he said, stifling a sigh. “I’m sorry I
can’t go with you, Grace.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say you will be happier with the marquis!”
she retorted, as she turned to the glass to arrange
her riding hat. “I only hope and trust that the marquis
will soon get better, and allow us to leave this place. I
was never in a duller hole in my life.”</p>

<p>“They call Pescia pretty, too,” he replied, absently, as
he followed her out and helped her to mount.</p>

<p>Then he lit a cigar, and was going across to the villa,
his mind heavy with thought, when suddenly Percy Levant
stopped in front of him and raised his hat.</p>

<p>Cecil’s face reddened for an instant; then, as he responded
to the greeting, he said:</p>

<p>“I had expected to see you before this, Mr. Levant.
Will you walk upstairs?”</p>

<p>Percy Levant declined the offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span></p>

<p>“What I have to say will take but a few minutes,” he
said, gravely. “We neither of us desire a prolonged interview.”</p>

<p>“I am at your service,” returned Lord Cecil, with a
slight bow.</p>

<p>Percy Levant eyed him with a strange expression,
scarcely that of resentment as of dull, heavy sadness.</p>

<p>“I presume, my lord, you conceive that I am here to demand
from, or offer, you the satisfaction which an appeal
to arms would afford both of us—both of us!” he added,
grimly.</p>

<p>“I can only say that I am prepared to accept any proposal
you may have to make, Mr. Levant,” said Lord
Cecil. “But I am obliged, in honor, to say this: I don’t
want you to take it as an apology; great Heavens, no!
But I’m bound to say that the words you heard me address
to Miss Marlowe the other evening were uttered in
complete ignorance that her word was plighted to you or
any other gentleman.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant bowed.</p>

<p>“Were you in ignorance that your word was plighted
to another lady?” he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil’s face flamed, then grew pale, and he sprang
from his lounging attitude against the mantel-shelf to an
upright position; but, with a palpable effort, he restrained
himself.</p>

<p>“That is a rebuke which I have deserved and must submit
to, Mr. Levant,” he said, grimly. “It is true that I
am engaged to Lady Grace Peyton, and that I had no
right to address Miss Marlowe as I did, but”—he turned
his face away for a moment—“but I think if you knew all
the circumstances of the case, you, even you, would feel
more inclined to pity than to condemn me. But I don’t
appeal to your consideration. As I said”—with a touch
of hauteur—“I am at your disposal, in any way, and at
any time.”</p>

<p>“You mean, of course, that you are ready to fight, my
lord?”</p>

<p>“You interpret my meaning,” replied Lord Cecil,
calmly. “I have no doubt you feel aggrieved. I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
if I stood in your place. I have no doubt Miss Marlowe”—his
lips quivered—“has told you of our past—our past
relationship——”</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe has told me nothing, but I have drawn
my own conclusions. I have been content to accept Miss
Marlowe’s silence—complete silence—respecting the
past.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” said Cecil, with a repressed sigh. “What
does it matter to you, who have the priceless boon of her
present and future love?”</p>

<p>The words were wrung from him, and he would have
recalled them if he could have done so, when he saw the
effect they produced upon Percy Levant, whose face grew
white, and whose eyes flashed.</p>

<p>But he, too, seemed to be striving for self-restraint.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you do not know all, my lord,” he said.
“But to come to the business which brought me here!
Miss Marlowe and I are to be married on the sixteenth!”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil bit his lip and nodded.</p>

<p>“So soon?” he said, almost inaudibly. “Well, sir, why
do you tell me this?”</p>

<p>“Because I have to make a proposal to you, my lord.
You expect a challenge from me?”</p>

<p>“I have expected it for the last three days, Mr. Levant.”</p>

<p>“Will you, my lord, permit me to withhold that challenge
until the sixteenth?”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil stared at him.</p>

<p>“Till the day of your marriage?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” returned Percy Levant. “Such a request
astonishes you, no doubt. It is only natural that you
should demand my reasons for this delay, but I shall ask,
as a favor, that you permit me to keep them to myself
until the sixteenth! I have another request to make,
which, I fear, you will deem as strange as those which
have preceded it.”</p>

<p>“Go on!” said Cecil, knitting his brows.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad if your lordship will permit me to call
at the Villa Vittoria, Lord Stoyle’s residence, at four
o’clock on the sixteenth. I shall have an explanation to
make, which you may consider an ample excuse for accepting
any challenge I may offer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>Cecil, after a moment’s perplexed consideration, turned
to him.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea of your motives in these requests,
Mr. Levant,” he said, with a quiet dignity, “but I
don’t think I can do anything else than grant them.
After all, I have no claim for satisfaction from you; the
offense lies with me.”</p>

<p>“Just so, my lord,” said Percy Levant, taking his hat.
“I wish you good-morning. On the sixteenth you and
I shall understand each other more easily.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Cecil, grimly. “One moment,” he
added, hesitatingly, as Percy Levant turned to leave the
room. “Is—is Miss Marlowe in Pescia?” he asked, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe is in Pescia, my lord,” replied Percy
Levant, looking at him steadily.</p>

<p>Cecil’s face grew hot.</p>

<p>“Will you tell her that—that I knew nothing of her engagement?
No! tell her nothing!”</p>

<p>“I think that is far the better course, my lord,” said
Percy Levant, and with another bow he went.</p>

<p class="center">CONSPIRATORS.</p>


<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill had been having the very good
time which a man might be expected to have who has had
a magnificent palace with a host of obsequious servants
placed at his disposal, and who is monarch of all he surveys—of
another person’s property.</p>

<p>He enjoyed himself most amazingly. He went on
pleasant little excursions to the neighboring towns; he ordered
the richest and most luxurious dinners; he accepted
the best of the numerous invitations which Lady Despard’s
neighbors freely accorded him, as a friend of her
ladyship left in charge of the Villa Rimini, and wherever
he went he was voted a most charming and agreeable
companion. Indeed, since Percy Levant’s departure no
one had so completely won the hearts of the Florentine
ladies as Mr. Spenser Churchill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>And do not for a moment suppose that the good man
gave himself up to carnal enjoyment without giving
thought to his less fortunate fellowmen. No! The eminent
and tender-hearted philanthropist remembered his
poor brethren, and gave such touching accounts of the
various charitable societies with which he was connected—“The
Sweeps’ Orphanage,” “The Indigent Knife
Grinders’ Society,” “The Society for the Distribution of
Knives and Forks to the South Sea Islanders,” and so on,
that he succeeded in collecting a very tidy sum for these
eminently deserving and practical charities; and everybody
agreed that if ever there was a man too good for this
sinful and selfish world, Mr. Spenser Churchill was indeed
that individual!</p>

<p>And so the days passed pleasantly—and profitably—and
on the morning of the sixteenth Mr. Spenser Churchill
was sitting over the second bottle of Lady Despard’s
choicest claret, with a cigarette between his lips, and his
benevolent eyes half-closed, with that expression of bland
peace and serenity which only the truly good can experience,
when a servant brought him a letter.</p>

<p>He eyed it with sleepy indifference until he saw the
writing, and the man had left the room; then he tore the
letter open eagerly.</p>

<p>“Dear Churchill,” it ran, “the marriage takes place to-morrow
morning. Come, without fail, to the Villa Vittoria
here, at four o’clock to-morrow afternoon.—P. L.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser Churchill’s face grew radiant.</p>

<p>“I knew he’d do it! I knew it! What an eye for
character I have! I should have made a good general!
I know how to pick my men. I was confident Percy
would do what I wanted! To-morrow! Oh, yes, I’ll
be there. Spenser, my dear friend, you have won the
trick; you have——” He stopped, and a shade crossed
his benevolent face. “I wish I’d made it twenty thousand,
instead of ten,” he muttered, wistfully; “I might just as
well have done so—he would not have said anything, and
she wouldn’t have missed it. Why, her mother’s portion,
of settlement money, will bring her five-and-twenty thousand
a year, and that will which the marquis is not capable
of altering makes her the mistress of all his money. Yes,
I might just as well have had twenty! However”—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
the smile beamed out again—“dear Percy shall make it up
to me. He wouldn’t like his wife to know of our little
contract, I should think, and I might feel it my duty to
tell her, unless—unless he made it worth my while to
hold my tongue. Yes, Churchill, my dear friend, you
have warmed your nest pretty well; and now”—filling his
glass—“now for the enjoyment. No more of these
beastly charitable societies; no longer any need for playing
the saint. Let me see—I’ll live in Paris, I think, most
of my time. A man can enjoy himself in Paris without a
parcel of fools interfering or holding him up to censure!
In Paris or—yes, Constantinople. That’s not bad! Oh,
what a time I will have! And Cecil, dear Cecil, who used
to sneer at me and treat me as if I were an impostor; I
think, yes, I think, dear Cecil, I shall have the laugh on
you this time, you and your beautiful bride! For I’m
afraid I shall feel it my duty to tell you how completely
you have been fooled. Yes, I think I must do that, really!
To-morrow! To-morrow the new life begins. Hem!
well, the old one hasn’t been so bad! The charitable
business has paid, it certainly has paid; but no more of it;
I’m sick of it and the whole cant of it. I’ll enjoy myself
in a proper fashion, enjoy myself in my honestly earned
wealth. Let me see! Ten thousand pounds, with what
I have—ahem!—saved, together with say a thousand or
two a year out of dear Percy—how grateful he will be,
of course—will make a nice little income. Spenser, my
dear boy, you are a genius, and you ought to have been a
general. Here’s your health and your future happiness!”
and, with a chuckle, he filled his glass till it ran over, and
drained it at a draught.</p>

<p>The Italians are not fond of high houses, and the Villa
Vittoria, like most of its fellows in Pescia, covered a long
space of ground, its rooms being arranged on two stories,
with very few stairs and fewer corridors.</p>

<p>The apartments which the marquis occupied for his
own personal use consisted of a sitting-room, and a dressing-room
and bedroom adjoining, the latter divided from
the sitting-room by heavy curtains. On the other side of
the center room was a small anteroom which the marquis
had not used; it was intended as a reception-room for
tradespeople or persons who paid visits of business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span></p>

<p>Percy Levant on the occasion of his interview with the
marquis had noticed—very few things escaped his quick
eyes—the arrangement of the rooms, and at half-past
three on the afternoon of the sixteenth, the valet, who
had received his instructions from Percy, ushered that
gentleman, Lady Despard and Doris—who were closely
veiled—into the anteroom, and softly closed the door.</p>

<p>Lady Despard raised her veil and shrugged her shoulders
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are, my dear Percy,” she said, in a low
voice; “but I don’t think any one else in this world but
you would have induced me to have come; and do you
mean to say that you still decline to give us any explanation
of these extraordinary proceedings?”</p>

<p>He shook his head as he drew Doris to a chair, into
which she sank with a weary but resigned gesture.</p>

<p>“And you think that you are treating us properly by all
this mystery; and on the dear child’s wedding day; for I
suppose you two mean to be married this evening? Or is
this but a preliminary to the breaking-off of the match;
for, of course, I can see something is the matter between
you two?” and she dropped into the chair with a movement
of impatience.</p>

<p>“I shall be ready to marry Doris this evening,” said
Percy Levant, holding Doris’ hand. “It rests with her to
decide, dear Lady Despard,” and he crossed the room and
bent over her appealingly. “When you consented to come
here with her this afternoon, you did so knowing that I
should have to keep you in ignorance of my motives; do
you think I am not grateful for your confidence in me?
Do you think I would inflict unnecessary pain on dear
Doris?”</p>

<p>“N-o—I don’t!” she said, with languid irritability; “I’m
quite ready to admit that you love her to distraction, but it
certainly is enough to drive one out of one’s senses, these
mysterious proceedings of yours; and Doris tells me
nothing lately,” she added.</p>

<p>Doris raised her lovely eyes pleadingly, but remained
silent.</p>

<p>“Don’t blame her,” said Percy Levant, gravely. “She,
too, is in ignorance of this, which I am about to do, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
my motives! She trusts me; will not you, Lady Despard?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I must,” she said, shrugging her
shoulders. “But why have we come here? My acquaintance
with the marquis is too slight to excuse this
intrusion.”</p>

<p>“If it is an intrusion, that which will result from it will
excuse it,” he said. “The fact is,” and he smiled rather
sadly, “I have arranged a little comedy for your ladyship’s
amusement! Comedy and tragedy, alas, are very
thinly divided; there is but a step between them. All I
ask of you is that you will remain quiet and silent, whatever
you may hear; and I intend you to hear all. Doris
I can rely on,” and he laid his hand upon her arm with a
reverent, gentle touch.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not hysterical or nervous,” said Lady Despard.
“I shan’t shriek, however sensational your conjuring
trick—or whatever it is—may be. Come and sit
beside me, dear, will you! and, Percy, remember, if the
marquis should hear of our visit here, and want to know
why on earth we came, I shall refer him to you.”</p>

<p>“I abide by that,” he said, gravely. “And now I am
going to leave you——” he added, as they heard the valet
speaking to some one in the hall. “Doris,” and he bent
over her, “you will be patient and brave?”</p>

<p>She looked at him trustingly.</p>

<p>“I will be silent, at least. I can promise that,” she
said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I am content with that,” he said. “And—and if you
should hear that which might shake your faith in me——”
he asked, his face pale and his lips quivering.</p>

<p>“Nothing can do that,” she responded.</p>

<p>“We shall see,” he said, almost inaudibly, and left them,
closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>Lady Despard took Doris’ hand and caressed it.</p>

<p>“For all my bravado, I feel rather nervous, dear,” she
said, with a forced laugh. “His manner has been so
strange of late, and you—you have had something on your
mind, Doris. Oh, of course I have seen that, though I
would rather have died than asked you to tell me!”</p>

<p>“And I think I would rather have died than tell you!”
said Doris, with something like a sob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span></p>

<p>“Has there been a quarrel between you? Do you want
the match broken off? For heaven’s sake, speak while
there’s time if you want it broken off!”</p>

<p>Doris shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>“No; I shall marry him this evening, if he wishes it!”
she murmured.</p>

<p>“If he wishes it! Why, of course—ah!” she broke off,
her hand closing nervously upon Doris’ burning fingers;
“that is Spenser Churchill’s voice!”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Spenser Churchill’s voice, and as he was
ushered into the center room he held out both hands to
Percy Levant and smiled his sweetest smile.</p>

<p>“My dear Percy, may I congratulate you? May I?”</p>

<p>“You may,” said Percy Levant, giving him a hand.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill drew a long breath and laughed, an
oily laugh of vast contentment.</p>

<p>“Happy bridegroom! Lucky fellow!” he murmured.
“This is the marriage day, eh?”</p>

<p>“This is the happy day, yes,” said Percy Levant. “Sit
down, won’t you? I’m afraid you are tired. Let me offer
you some wine?” He went to the sideboard. “I’m sorry
there’s nothing but brandy here. I’ll ring for some——”</p>

<p>“Pray don’t trouble, my dear Percy,” said Spenser
Churchill, blandly; “a little brandy is an excellent thing,
if taken in moderation.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant mixed a stiff glass, and placed it before
him.</p>

<p>“You can understand why I sent for you,” he said, seating
himself opposite to Spenser Churchill, whose back was
turned to the curtains which divided this room from the
marquis’ dressing-room. “My part of the contract being
fulfilled, I want to know what my position really is, and
whether this nonsense of yours has any particle of truth
in it?”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill stared indignantly.</p>

<p>“Young man!” he exclaimed, solemnly; “this is the first
time I have ever been accused—to my face—of falsehood!
This nonsense! If you allude to the agreement—the perfectly
legal agreement, which you signed, and which I
hold—you will discover that it is anything but nonsense.”</p>

<p>“I’m delighted to hear it, of course,” said Percy Levant;
“don’t be angry! Well, then, seeing that I am to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
give you ten thousand pounds as a fee for your assistance
in procuring me a wife, I should like to know exactly
how I am to manage it—I should like to know all
about my wife’s property.”</p>

<p>“Your wife! How well it sounds!” chuckled Spenser
Churchill; then his face grew suddenly suspicious. “By
the way, my dear Percy, have you the marriage certificate?
I am not of a suspicious nature. Heaven forbid! I am,
indeed, too trustful and confiding; but I should like to see
the certificate, my dear boy.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” assented Percy Levant, cheerfully; “I’ll go
and ask my wife for it. Indeed, she may as well be present——”</p>

<p>“No, no,” interrupted Spenser Churchill, putting out his
hand. “Never mind; don’t trouble. The fact is—ahem!—there
are some things which Mrs. Levant—Mrs.
Levant!—had better not hear. And to tell you the truth,
my dear fellow, your wife is a young lady I’m not over-anxious
to meet. There’s something about her which
makes me uncomfortable. I’ll—I’ll take a little more
brandy, my dear Percy—a capital and useful spirit, if used
in moderation. I have been recommended to take it by my
medical man.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant rose to get the decanter. As he did so,
the curtain parted and Lord Cecil Neville stood in the
opening.</p>

<p>Percy Levant made a circuit so as to approach him.</p>

<p>“Remember our understanding, my lord, and wait!”
he said, in a whisper.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil seemed to hesitate, his eyes fixed on Spenser
Churchill suspiciously; then he dropped the curtain, which
again concealed him.</p>

<p>“There you are! And now to business, Churchill.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to business,” said Spenser Churchill unctuously.
“I dare say, my dear Percy, you think I have earned that
ten thousand pounds very easily—by the way, it ought
to have been twenty, it ought, indeed!” and he shook his
head solemnly.</p>

<p>“I’d as soon pay you twenty as ten,” said Percy Levant,
carelessly.</p>

<p>“You would? Give me your hand, my dear boy!” exclaimed
Spenser Churchill, with blind enthusiasm. “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
are just what I always thought you—a noble youth, a
truly noble and unselfish young man! You would just as
soon give me twenty!”</p>

<p>“Yes, or thirty! I’m as unselfish as you are,” said
Percy.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill’s emotion was so great at this fresh
proof of his dear young friend’s unselfish generosity that
he was constrained to turn his head aside and wipe his
eyes.</p>

<p>“You are an honorable, a noble young man, my dear
boy!” he murmured. “And now I will lay the whole
story before you. But, as I said, don’t think I have not
earned the money! My dear Percy, are you aware that
your wife was once engaged to Lord Cecil Neville, the
marquis’ nephew, the heir to the title? Eh?” and he
chuckled.</p>

<p>“Really!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Oh, it’s true, and I assure you that they
would have made a marriage of it but for me. Oh, don’t
look so surprised. Bless my soul, if I am not a match for
a simple and confiding couple like those, why——” He
raised his hand. “But it was a troublesome affair, my
dear Percy, and cost me a deal of thought. And ra—ther
risky, too!” he added, thoughtfully. “Forged letters—ahem!—that
is fictitious correspondence, though rendered
inevitable by the circumstances of the case, is dangerous.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Percy Levant, distinctly. “You forged
letters from Lord Cecil Neville to Miss Marlowe——”</p>

<p>“Yes. But, quietly, my dear Percy. Bless my soul,
you and I don’t want to publish our little mutual confidences
on the housetops; and—er—this room is rather, I
say, rather, public, isn’t it? What’s behind those curtains?
Good gracious!” and he half rose.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, all the servants speak Italian,” said
Percy Levant, leaning back in his chair with a careless
and indifferent air. “While you speak English you are
quite safe!”</p>

<p>Spencer Churchill fell back.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right!” he said. “I rely on your discretion.
Well, it didn’t suit me that Cecil should marry Miss Marlowe
for several reasons. One being that I could not drive
a bargain with him as I could——” he stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span></p>

<p>“As you could with a penniless adventurer like me,”
finished Percy Levant. “I understand. And so you succeeded
in separating them and—selling her to me. That’s
quite clear. I’ve no doubt you managed it very cleverly;
I should think forgery and that kind of thing would come
easy to you, my dear Churchill.”</p>

<p>“Sir! Mr. Levant!” exclaimed Spenser Churchill,
pugnaciously, and half rising from his chair; then, as he
met the steady gaze of the dark eyes, he subsided again,
and waved his hand pityingly.</p>

<p>“My dear Percy, you wrong me. What I did, I did as
much in the interest of my dear friend, the Marquis of
Stoyle, and the young man himself. It was the marquis
who assisted me, I assure you. Packed dear Cecil off to
Ireland, and kept him there—kept him there—till I’d got
his ladylove away.”</p>

<p>The curtain stirred behind the self-satisfied, triumphant
plotter, but Percy Levant, unseen by his companion, held
up his hand warningly.</p>

<p>“Really! And the marquis is gratified, no doubt.
But, after all, this is not my business. I want to
know——”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill leaned forward and dropped his
voice, but not to so low a pitch but that the listeners on
either side of the room could hear distinctly.</p>

<p>“You want to know whom it is you have married. I’ll
tell you. Wait, you don’t know the Marquis of Stoyle?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen him,” said Percy. “Speak louder; what are
you afraid of, man? We are not two conspirators on the
stage!”</p>

<p>“Quite right, my dear Percy. Conspirators! Certainly
not! We are two men bound by a common impulse
to—to—relieve—benefit our fellow creatures, and—ourselves!”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Percy Levant. “But go on. Remember
that you have just congratulated me on my marriage,
and that I am anxious to join my bride.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Well, then, are you aware, my dear Percy,
that my friend the marquis was once married?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about the Marquis of Stoyle.”</p>

<p>“That he was married——” he stopped and laughed
with unctuous enjoyment. “When I think of it, my dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
boy, I’m always tickled by the desire to laugh. You must
know that the young lady had three lovers—the marquis,
a certain Jeffrey Flint, and—myself!” and he laid his hand
upon his heart and bowed.</p>

<p>As he did so, the curtains opened and three figures
stood in the opening. They were those of Cecil, Lady
Grace—and the trembling, emaciated form of the marquis
himself. White, deathly white, the old man stood, clinging
to Cecil’s arm, his piercing eyes fixed on the smooth,
long-haired head of Spenser Churchill, with an expression
that baffles all description.</p>

<p>Percy Levant rose, and, under the pretense of filling
Spenser Churchill’s glass, made a warning gesture to
them. Lady Grace seemed about to speak, but the marquis
turned upon her with an awful ferocity, which seemed
to deprive her of the power to speak or move.</p>

<p>Percy Levant sank back in his seat.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill sipped his brandy and water.</p>

<p>“Well, the case stood thus: The girl was engaged to
the fellow Jeffrey. Consequently there was no chance
for me. So, my dear Percy, I decided, as most men of
common sense would have decided, to—ahem!—assist the
marquis. I did so, and, bewildered and fascinated by the
offer of a marchioness’ coronet, Lucy accepted and married
the marquis. The result was—er—rather disastrous.
With all respect to my dear friend, the marquis, I must
say, my dear Percy, that if ever there was a fiend incarnate
he was one! I don’t wish to be hard upon a fellow mortal—Heaven
forbid!—but if there is anything worse, more
cruel and selfish and altogether unscrupulous than a fiend,
then that being may yield the palm to the Most Honorable
the Marquis of Stoyle!”</p>

<p>The marquis, shaking in every limb with fury, clutched
Cecil’s arm, who, with some difficulty restrained him from
rushing upon the oily-voiced speaker.</p>

<p>“Well, the natural result followed. The marchioness
fled. Where, and to whom? Why, to her former lover,
Jeffrey Flint. No, my dear Percy, her conduct was blameless.
She died within a few hours after reaching him.
She died, but she left a child, a girl, behind. That girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
Jeffrey Flint adopted and called—can you guess her
name?”</p>

<p>“Doris Marlowe,” said Percy Levant, hoarsely, and
with white lips—for this was a revelation to him.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill lolled back in his chair with an unctuous
smile of enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Right! Quite right, my dear Percy! Doris Marlowe!
That is—ah, ah!—Mrs. Percy Levant!”</p>

<p>The marquis staggered, and clutched at Lord Cecil,
and Lady Grace was rushing forward, but Cecil raised his
hand, and, holding her face in her hands, she sank back.</p>

<p>“So Doris Marlowe is the daughter of the Marquis of
Stoyle?” said Percy Levant.</p>

<p>“Just so,” assented Spenser Churchill. “And now, my
dear Percy, that cat is out of the bag; the daughter of
the Marquis of Stoyle—in other words, Lady Mary
Neville! And the money! Well, I think you won’t regret
your liberal offer when I tell you that her mother’s
portion amounts to five-and-twenty thousand a year, and
that her father has made a will which will leave all he can
leave to her.”</p>

<p>“Which he can unmake!” said Percy Levant.</p>

<p>“I think not,” murmured Spenser Churchill, blandly.
“There have been later wills, I think, but—ahem!—I have
taken charge of them——”</p>

<p>“You are a clever fellow, Churchill.”</p>

<p>“Y—es, I think I am! I honestly, and modestly, think
I am! I ought to have been a great statesman, or a general,
my dear Percy.”</p>

<p>“You ought, indeed!” said Percy Levant. “But—pardon
me!—although I believe every word you say most implicitly,
I am afraid the world, including the marquis, will
want some proofs. It is all very well to say that Miss
Marlowe—that is, my wife,” he put in, hurriedly—“is
Lord Stoyle’s daughter; but proof, proof, my dear fellow!”</p>

<p>“You’re no fool, either, Percy,” said Spenser Churchill.
“Of course, we want proofs, and here they are!” and he
took some papers from his pocket. “Here is the certificate
of marriage of Lucy—Miss Marlowe’s mother—to
the marquis; the certificate of Miss Marlowe’s otherwise
Lady Mary Neville’s, birth, a full and exhaustive statement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
of Lady Stoyle on her deathbed, duly attested; and a
statement of Jeffrey Flint. Pretty complete, I think.”</p>

<p>“Complete, indeed! And how did you get them,
Churchill? Upon my word, you are a cleverer man even
than I thought you.”</p>

<p>“How did I get them?” he repeated, lowering his voice;
“I got them from Jeffrey Flint.”</p>

<p>“He gave them to you?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly! My dear Percy, I took them. What
use are papers to a dead man?” He stopped and turned
pale, as the scene of Jeffrey’s death rose before him. “But
don’t let us talk of it; it—it was a most unpleasant affair,
I assure you, my dear Percy. But you will, with your
quick intelligence, soon understand how, once having
those papers in my possession, I saw my way to making,
with your assistance and Lady Grace’s, a <i>grande coup</i>!”</p>

<p>“Lady Grace’s, eh?” said Percy.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill laughed softly.</p>

<p>“My dear Percy, never despise women. They may be
fools—I fear they generally are—but they are, oh, they
are so useful! Without Lady Grace I could have done
little or nothing; but she was really invaluable. Cecil—dear
Cecil—was always suspicious of me; but, of course,
he trusted Lady Grace, and she and I between us caught
him. ‘Caught him’ is the only expression applicable! To
this day he considers himself under an obligation to her
which only marriage can repay.” He laughed. “Poor
Cecil; I can’t help pitying him; for between you and me,
my dear Percy, I’d rather marry a tigress than beautiful
Lady Grace! But don’t let us talk of him or her. Let us
talk of ourselves. The whole thing has gone splendidly,
though I say it. Providence, my dear Percy,” and he
turned up his eyes, “has been on our side. The dear
marquis—how surprised he would be if he knew this true
story I have revealed to you!—is lying in a senseless and
utterly incapable condition in London; Cecil and Lady
Grace are going to be, if they are not already, married;
and you—you, my dear Percy, are the happy husband of
Lady Mary, the daughter of the Marquis of Stoyle!
Think of it! Realize it, and oh, my dear Percy, make it
twenty instead of the ten thousand you agreed upon!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
Here are the papers. They are at your service; indeed, I
consider that they belong to you——”</p>

<p>He pushed the papers across the table, smiling with oily
triumph and satisfaction, and Percy Levant leaned forward
to take them, when a thin, wasted hand clutched
them clawlike and a harsh, strained voice said:</p>

<p>“No! They are mine!”</p>

<p>Percy Levant sank back into his chair, and wiped the
perspiration from his brow; but Spenser Churchill sprang
from his seat, and grabbed at the papers mechanically.
Then, as he encountered the piercing eyes fixed upon him,
he, too, sank back, and, in a terrified voice, gasped:</p>

<p>“The marquis!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">FOILED.</p>


<p>“The marquis!” gasped Spenser Churchill, and he sank
back, still staring at the haggard and wasted face, from
which the piercing eyes glared down at him like ardent
coals, with a fearful, horrified gaze.</p>

<p>Then he half-rose, and, with a grotesque attempt at
a smile, wagged his head at Percy Levant, who stood
erect and alert.</p>

<p>“This—this—is a very pretty little plot, my dear
Percy,” he said; “but you don’t imagine that the dear
marquis will take your word against mine? Marquis,”
and he managed to raise his eyes to the fierce face with
a ghastly attempt at a smile, “I am sorry that you should
have been deceived by what was palpably an attempt
on my part to lure this gentleman into a trap. He is—you
don’t know him, but I do, and I must introduce him.
This man is an adventurer, a scamp who would sell his
soul for a ten-pound note. You won’t let his word weigh
against mine—against Spenser Churchill’s!”</p>

<p>“It is quite true, my lord,” said Percy Levant. “As
this man says—I am an adventurer. I have been willing
to sell my soul for a ten-pound note; I am utterly unworthy
of belief,” his voice grew hoarse and broken,
“and it is only the influence of a woman’s pure and spotless
nature that has, at the eleventh hour, induced me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
to stop short in the villainous work to which this man
tempted me. I am as bad as he—up to this point. I
ask for no mercy, no indulgence, no credit; from his own
lips you shall judge him, and from the papers you have
in your hand.”</p>

<p>The marquis just glanced at him—no more, then
turned his fierce eyes upon Spenser Churchill again.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Spenser Churchill, shrugging his
shoulders, and stretching a trembling hand toward his
hat. “I—I leave the whole business to you, my dear
marquis. I will not condescend to—to answer the accusations
which—which——” He shuffled nearer to the
door, and his heart rose as he saw that neither Percy
Levant nor the marquis made any attempt to stop him—“which
my character will enable me to—to repel. I wish
you success, Mr. Percy Levant, and—and good-morning.”</p>

<p>He made an ironical bow as he backed toward the
door, and was turning to make a rush for it, when Lord
Cecil stepped before him.</p>

<p>At sight of him Spenser Churchill’s face grew livid,
and he put up his hand as if to ward off an expected
blow; but Lord Cecil scarcely looked at him, and passed
to the marquis’ side.</p>

<p>“Is—is this true, my lord?” he demanded, hoarsely.</p>

<p>The marquis dropped into a chair, and, still clutching
the papers, gazed up at him with a wild despair which
would have touched even Lord Cecil if he had not loved
Doris too well to think of any one but her.</p>

<p>“It is true, my lord!” said Percy Levant, solemnly
and sorrowfully. “Would to Heaven that both he and
I had lied! It is true, every word of it! The separation
between Miss Marlowe and yourself was worked by
Spenser Churchill. He did, by word and deed, sell her
to me.”</p>

<p>Lord Cecil made a movement as if to strike him, but
Percy Levant stood patient and unresisting.</p>

<p>“And yet more, my lord! It was he who set the trap
which caught you and handed you, fettered and bound,
to his accomplice.”</p>

<p>“Grace! It is—it must be—a lie!” broke from Cecil’s
white lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span></p>

<p>A hollow laugh rang out behind him, and Lady Grace
glided from her dressing-room. All eyes were fixed
upon her as she stood, her exquisitely-clad form posed
in an attitude of contemptuous defiance. A hectic flush
burned on her cheeks, and she swept the group with a
disdainful glance, as she fanned herself.</p>

<p>“Permit me to bear my testimony to this gentleman’s
veracity,” she said. Spenser’s face, which had cleared
suddenly at her appearance, fell again, and he shrank
back and leaned against the wall, where he stood, nervously
passing his hands over each other. “What he
states is quite correct. I don’t know how he discovered
it, but he seems to have made a tool of ‘dear’ Mr.
Churchill, while ‘dear’ Mr. Churchill was under the pleasing
delusion that he had got a submissive and willing
dupe in him. It is probable that he knows the whole
scheme. For it was a scheme, Cecil, and,” with a disdainful
smile, “a very good one. Any but the most
trustful of men would have seen through it. I compliment
you, my dear Cecil—I suppose I must say Lord
Cecil now!—upon your credulity.”</p>

<p>Cecil looked at her; then hung his head with shame—for
her, seeing her utter shamelessness.</p>

<p>“I am utterly at a loss to conceive why my dear Mr.
Churchill should have exerted himself on my behalf.
Of course, I knew it was from no love he bore me—but
I understand it all now!”</p>

<p>Cecil turned his back upon her, and, leaning his elbow
on the mantel-shelf, covered his eyes with his hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Spenser Churchill is really and truly a remarkably
clever man; but, like some other clever men, he has
chosen his tools badly. I can’t understand why he
should have confided in a person of Mr. Levant’s character!”
and she shot a contemptuous glance from under
her half-closed lids at his pale face. “But having done
so, he has, of course, been betrayed. ‘Put not your trust
in—adventurers’ will for the future be an excellent motto
for him!” She laughed, and the fan moved a little more
quickly. “And now, having borne my testimony to the
truth of Mr. Levant’s assertions, I have only to express
my sympathy for ‘dear’ Mr. Churchill’s discomfiture, and
your disappointment, my dear Cecil”—her face grew red,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
and her delicately-molded nostrils expanded with a
malignant enjoyment—“your terrible disappointment!
If you had only known all this a few hours earlier, why,
you would have thrown off your new love, and been on
with the old! But as it is, Mr. Levant, with all his
newly-born penitence, has been clever enough to secure
Miss Marlowe, otherwise the marquis’ daughter, for his
wife, and you are tricked. It is a vulgar word, Lord
Cecil, but it is the only suitable one.” She laughed
again, and her fan moved rapidly. “Won’t you see—or
do you?—this penitent and remorse-stricken gentleman’s
game? You don’t! Why, you observe that he has married
the lady he wanted, and by his betrayal of his accomplice
saved his ten thousand pounds. Mr. Levant, I congratulate
you upon your dexterity,” and she made him a
sweeping curtsey. “Mr. Spenser Churchill is clever, I
admit. I, too, always had an idea that I possessed a
turn for intrigue; but you—oh, you are a genius, and the
honors remain in your deserving hands.”</p>

<p>Percy Levant remained as silent, as impressive, as a
statue; but Spenser Churchill, whose face had reflected
every word Lady Grace had uttered, began to draw himself
upright, and a low, chuckling laugh broke from him.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said, half-gloatingly, half-fearfully;
“you and I are out of the game, dear Lady Grace; but
I think—I really do think that dear Lord Cecil is in the
same boat! Yes, Mr. Levant has been one too many for
us all. All! My dear Cecil, you have my profound
sympathy in the loss of the young lady you had set your
heart on. My dear marquis, if I may be permitted to
offer a word of humble advice, I should recommend you
to forgive your newly found daughter, the ballet girl—no!
pardon, the actress; and welcome as a son-in-law the
gentleman upon whom she has bestowed her hand. It is
true that he is an adventurer; that he sprang from the
gutter; that he bought her and captured her by a plot;
but he is her husband after all, and, really, he is no worse
than the stock from which she sprang. He will be a
worthy addition to the house of Stoyle! Forgive the
young couple—the adventurer and the actress—and
make them happy with your blessing. Do! my dear
marquis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span></p>

<p>Lord Cecil’s hand closed spasmodically, but he kept
it at his side; Percy Levant stood silent and impassive,
and the marquis merely raised his eyes from the paper
upon which they had been fixed.</p>

<p>“I—I really don’t think we need remain any longer,
dear Lady Grace,” murmured Spenser Churchill. “I
really don’t think we have any right to intrude upon this
happy family party. We must leave them to settle their
little differences, eh? Allow me to escort you to your
hotel. I have to preside at a charitable meeting in London
the day after to-morrow, alas! or I should like to
remain and see the mutual reconciliation; but duty—duty.”
He crept nearer the door and offered his arm,
but Lady Grace, with a haughty gesture, waved him off.</p>

<p>“No? You would like to linger till the denouement?
Yes? Then I must go alone——”</p>

<p>“Stop!” said Percy Levant, quietly.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill pulled up and looked at him sideways.
“I—I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>“Move at your peril,” said Percy, sternly.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill sidled toward the window, and with
a quick movement threw it open.</p>

<p>“You mean to threaten me, detain me, offer me violence,
my dear Percy,” he said, with a leer. “I think
not. If any person—any person,” and he glanced at
Lord Cecil, “presumes to prevent my departure, I shall
call for assistance. There are police in the street, who
will protect me, an English gentleman of unblemished
character and honorable repute. There are police, I
say.”</p>

<p>“There are,” said Percy Levant, quietly and incisively.
“There is an English detective at the door ready to arrest
you.”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill shrank back from the window.</p>

<p>“Indeed! On what charge, pray?”</p>

<p>“Conspiracy, and robbery from the dead!” and he
pointed to the papers which had been stolen from Jeffrey
Flint’s body.</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill’s face grew white, but he forced a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Conspiracy, eh? The other is nonsense, utter nonsense!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
Who’s to prove—ahem! But, conspiracy? With
whom? With Mr. Percy Levant?”</p>

<p>“With Mr. Percy Levant,” repeated Percy, grimly.
“Your fellow criminal! One step, one cry for assistance,
and he arrests us both.”</p>

<p>Spenser Churchill clutched the curtain.</p>

<p>“You—you—traitor!” he gasped.</p>

<p>Percy Levant turned to Lord Cecil.</p>

<p>“I have simply stated the truth, my lord. A detective
is waiting outside. It rests with you; it is for you to
decide whether you will charge us. One thing remains
for me to do.”</p>

<p>He went to the door of the anteroom, and taking Doris’
hand led her toward the group.</p>

<p>“Doris,” he said, in a low voice that trembled and
broke for the first time. “Doris—your father!”</p>

<p>With pale face, wet with tears, Doris stood for a moment,
irresolute. The old man, who had raised his head
as her name smote upon his ear, made an effort to rise;
then sank back with outstretched hands and piteously
pleading face.</p>

<p>“My child, my child!” he cried, hoarsely.</p>

<p>It would have required a harder heart than Doris’ to
resist such an appeal, an appeal for forgiveness, a cry of
penitence and remorse. She hesitated a moment, while
one could count twenty. Then she was at his knee, and
his weak, quivering hands were upon her head.</p>

<p>Lady Grace, panting with the suppressed fury of jealousy,
glanced at the picture which nearly moved two of
the spectators to tears.</p>

<p>“How—how charming!” she said in a harsh voice.
“Father and daughter. You have only to extend your
blessing to the husband, my lord!” and she swept a contemptuous
courtesy on Percy Levant.</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t forget the wily adventurer, the music
teacher of Soho, your son-in-law, dear marquis!” pursued
Spenser Churchill, sardonically.</p>

<p>The marquis started, and looked up at Percy Levant
piteously.</p>

<p>“Are you—are you her husband?” he managed to
articulate.</p>

<p>Percy Levant turned his haggard face toward him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
“No, my lord,” he said, hoarsely, “we are not, and never
shall be, married.”</p>

<p>The marquis drew a long breath. “No!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Percy Levant, almost inaudibly. “If I had
loved her less——” he stopped. “My love for her has
saved her, my lord. Miss Marlowe—Lady Mary—is free
from any claims from me.”</p>

<p>Lady Grace’s fan came to a sudden stoppage.</p>

<p>“Not married!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Not married!” echoed Spenser Churchill, in accents
of malignant disappointment.</p>

<p>Percy Levant looked at them both with a steady gaze.
“Not married,” he said. “You may go now, Spenser
Churchill.”</p>

<p>“No!” cried a grave voice. It was Lord Cecil’s; and
he sprang to the window. “Not till justice——”</p>

<p>Percy Levant folded his arms and stood resigned and
patient.</p>

<p>“Not till justice has been satisfied. I charge you,
Spenser Churchill, with conspiracy——”</p>

<p>“And—and—Levant, and Lady Grace!” said Spenser
Churchill, with a leer.</p>

<p>“I am ready,” said Percy Levant, quietly.</p>

<p>But as he spoke Doris sprang to her feet, and, gently
putting her father’s arm aside, stood in front of Percy
Levant.</p>

<p>“No!” she cried, panting; “I say no!”</p>

<p>Percy Levant drew a long breath. “Let the law take
its course, Lady Mary!” he said, in a low voice. But she
still stood in front of him as if to shield and protect him.</p>

<p>The marquis held out his hand to her as if he could not
bear her to leave his side.</p>

<p>“Come to me, come to me. Let them—let them go,”
and he glanced in the direction of Lady Grace and Spenser
Churchill.</p>

<p>The latter did not wait for the permission to be repeated.
With an air of long-suffering patience and
saintly resignation, he shook his head reproachfully at
Percy Levant.</p>

<p>“Judas!” he murmured, “we shall have a day of reckoning,
we two, Judas!”</p>

<p>Percy Levant scarcely glanced at him; and Spenser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
Churchill as he moved slowly to the door, smiled a ghastly
smile at Lady Grace. “Let me escort you from this exclusively
family party, dear Lady Grace,” he said, sardonically.
But, like most conspirators when the plot has
failed, she drew back and eyed him scornfully.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mr. Churchill; but I have no further use for
you.”</p>

<p>At this turning of the tables, at this repudiation by the
woman he had regarded and used as a tool and dupe,
Spenser Churchill was almost overcome, and his light eyes
flashed viciously; then, with an effort that must have
caused him a great deal of self-restraint, he checked himself,
and stretching out his hand and casting up his eyes
to the ceiling, said decorously, and proudly:</p>

<p>“I forgive you, Lady Grace. I pity you, and I shall
not forget to remember you in my prayers. Poor
woman!”</p>

<p>Now, Lady Grace ought to have turned her back upon
him in silent contempt, but she had been sorely strained,
and this, the hypocritical taunting of the worm who had
a few moments ago been ready to crawl at the feet of his
accusers, was the last straw which broke the back of her
self-restraint, and as Mr. Spenser Churchill passed her, I
regret to say that she closed her fan sharply and struck
him across the face with it. Lady Grace possessed a
magnificent arm; the fan was a large one, of carved ivory,
with many sharp corners. Mr. Spenser Churchill uttered
a howl of pain, and fled.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil approached her and offered her his arm.
She had merely, if not quite, wrecked his life, she had
caused pain and suffering to the girl he loved, she was
unworthy of one moment’s pity, but he remembered that
she was a woman, and that she would have been his wife,
and he offered her his arm in silence. She looked up at
his face with a quick, almost agonized, questioning, then
turned from him, her face white, her lips quivering.</p>

<p>“No!” she said, almost inaudibly, “there can be no half
way for us. Friend or foe, Cecil! Will you keep your
promise to me?” She had no need to go further; his
face, grave and grim, answered for him. With a swift
compression of her lips she caught up a shawl that hung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
on a chair, and without lifting her eyes to his face, again
slowly left the room.</p>

<p>Percy Levant took up his hat and went to Lady Despard,
who was standing beside Doris.</p>

<p>“Will you—will you stay with her and—and help her?
She was never more in need of your love than now,” and
he glanced significantly at the white face of the old man
at whose knees Doris knelt.</p>

<p>She nodded silently, and Percy Levant, as he passed
Lord Cecil, said in a low voice:</p>

<p>“I hold myself at your disposal, my lord, completely,
entirely, without any reservation.” Then he stopped and
looked at Doris—a look impossible to describe, easy
enough to imagine—and seemed about to speak, but
with a sigh he turned and walked out, and Doris scarcely
knew that he had gone.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

</div>

<p class="center">RETRIBUTION.</p>


<p>Lady Despard and Lord Cecil stood beside the
marquis’ bed, at which, still holding the hand now slowly
growing cold, Doris knelt. Death, whom the old man,
with the stubborn obstinacy of the Stoyle race, had
hitherto kept at bay, was drawing near, very near. They
had carried him from the adjoining room, speechless and
sightless, and so he had remained through the long hours
of the night. It was morning now, and white and weary
with all she had undergone, Doris saw the rosy streaks
faintly penetrating the window shutters.</p>

<p>Now and again the valet or the doctor, or perhaps
Cecil, moistened the old man’s lips; and now and again
Doris smoothed the pillow, which might have been of
stone for all it mattered to the head that rested on it.
On the bed, and clasped tightly between the rigid
fingers, were the papers which proved her right to the
title of a peer’s daughter, and beside them the will which
might make her the mistress of the Stoyle wealth. Suddenly,
quite suddenly, as if, though appearing so incapable
of effort, the old man had been battling in the darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
for consciousness and strength, the marquis opened
his eyes and looked at her.</p>

<p>“Doris!” he said. “Mary!”</p>

<p>“I am here!” she said, inaudibly to all but him.</p>

<p>His fingers closed on her hand. “Cecil—all who are
here!” They drew closer to him, and he flashed his dim
eyes upon them. “Listen to me. These are my last
words. I—I acknowledge this lady to be my—my
daughter—the child of my wife, Lucy!” A spasm shot
across his face. “My will—the will which leaves all to
her—is my last. Remember—remember! My daughter—my
child!” His eyes closed, and they thought he
was dead, but his lips opened again, and Doris, if no
other, heard the words that struggled from them.
“Lucy! Lucy! forgive! I am punished—punished!”</p>

<p>These were the last words of the great Marquis of
Stoyle, who had all his life boasted that he had earned
the title of “wicked,” whose heart had never once melted
until death came to turn it into the dust to which even
penitence and remorse are impossible!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The wicked flourish as the bay-tree, and the truly good
are unable to live through persecution. If any one imagines
that Mr. Spenser Churchill was utterly annihilated
by the disclosure of his pretty plot, that person is very
little acquainted with the peculiar character of which Mr.
Spenser Churchill was a prominent type. For a week or
two the good man betook himself to Paris, and there, in
that quiet and peaceful spot, soothed his troubled spirits
with, doubtless, pious reflections; but shortly afterward
he emerged from his retreat, and the papers of London
announced that the great philanthropist would deliver a
lecture at Exeter Hall to aid the funds of the Broken-winded
Horses’ Society. The subject of the lecture was
to be a glorious and inspiring one: “Truth.”</p>

<p>Punctually at the hour announced the eminent man,
with placidly serene face, and softly, tenderly melting
eyes, stepped on to the platform, amidst the cheering of
the audience, the majority of whom were ladies, who
waved their pocket handkerchiefs, which they well knew
they should presently require. Mr. Spenser Churchill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
began his address. It was eloquent, touching, impressive;
the handkerchiefs grew quite moist long before it
was concluded, and when at last his soft and tearfully
sympathetic voice died away in his final words, many a
soft-hearted woman—and dare I say soft-headed man?—felt
perfectly convinced that Mr. Spenser Churchill was
far, far too good for this wicked world!</p>

<p>I am surely convinced that the hour will come in
which the world will see him without his mask, and be
ready to stone the hypocritical villain whom they almost
worshiped as a saint; but the hour has not yet come,
and the great philanthropist still flourishes as the bay-tree.
Great will be the fall thereof when the truth he so
loves to talk about shall prevail, and the ax lays the accomplished
hypocrite low! May we be there to see!</p>

<p>A year passed away, and the sun, which goes on shining,
though marquises die and hypocrites continue to
flourish, shone through Lady Despard’s beautiful boudoir
in Chester Gardens.</p>

<p>In her favorite attitude—half-reclining, half-sitting—her
ladyship nestled among the soft cushions of her favorite
couch. Near her sat Doris—who, though known
to the world as Lady Mary Stoyle, shall be Doris to us
till the end of this eventful history. She was sitting at
a writing-table, spread with letters and volumes, some
of them fearfully like pages of account books, and her
beautiful face was puckered up with a charming frown.</p>

<p>Every now and then she consulted one of the appalling
volumes, and then wrote for a few moments, after which
operation she would grow more puckered and draw a
series of perplexed and bothered sighs.</p>

<p>“How happy you look, dear!” said Lady Despard,
with a smile, after watching her for some time.</p>

<p>Doris started slightly, and turned round to her.</p>

<p>“I thought you had gone away hours—days—weeks
ago. Happy! I am almost driven to distraction. I
wish—oh, I do wish, there were no such things as accounts!
or, at any rate, that I had nothing to do with
them.”</p>

<p>Lady Despard laughed.</p>

<p>“‘Muckle coin, muckle care,’ my dear. Though I
sympathize with your misery, I must confess I rather enjoy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
the sight of it. I suffered so much when I came
into my own property. Oh, the weary, weary hours I
plodded through heavy columns of figures and dreary
‘statements.’ But I’ve got used to it, and that’s what
you will do, in time.”</p>

<p>“In time! Yes, when I have grown prematurely old
and gray,” said Doris, with a vexed smile. “I never understood
what hard work it is, this being rich.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid we shouldn’t like it if we were very poor.
I wonder”—she paused a moment, then went on—“I
wonder how a certain marquis likes poverty?”</p>

<p>Doris bent lower over her blundering and utterly futile
arithmetic. “I don’t know,” she said, stiffly.</p>

<p>Lady Despard smiled. “Any one would know you
were a Stoyle by your pride, my dear,” she remarked.</p>

<p>Doris looked up with affected indignation.</p>

<p>“Pride! I am the meekest and humblest——”</p>

<p>“Of empresses,” put in Lady Despard. “My dear
girl, you may not know it, but you are as proud a minx
as ever lived, and the most unforgiving.”</p>

<p>Doris looked over her shoulder for a moment, then
turned her head away.</p>

<p>“I think you are unjust,” she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I’m not. For instance, here are you suddenly
become possessed of a grand title, large estates,
and heaps of money. The title you can’t help taking, if
people choose to call you by it, and the money. Well,
you take as little of that as possible; but not once have
you set your foot in any one of the houses that are
yours, or upon a spot of the many acres which your
father left you. That’s pride, though of course you’ll
say it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“I——”</p>

<p>“I haven’t finished yet. Counsel for the prosecution
first, if you please; afterward we shall be happy to hear
what you have to say in defense——”</p>

<p>“And find me guilty, whatever that may be,” said
Doris.</p>

<p>“Here, too, is a young woman with two lovers——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t,” muttered Doris, wincing; but Lady Despard
declined to show mercy.</p>

<p>“My dear, I am going to continue. It is well that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
you should hear the truth from some one, and, as I am
the only person who dares tell it to your royal highness,
why, I’ll do my duty. Two lovers. One was utterly
unworthy of you, poor fellow, an adventurer, who—but
never mind. He repented in time, and I am not the
woman to be hard upon him. The other is a young man
who loved you devotedly, and is all that is honorable
and lovable—and miserable! He never wronged you in
any way, and, though I can understand your sending the
penitent adventurer about his business, I cannot understand
how you could let poor Cecil go to this beastly
little war, where, as likely as not, he will either be killed
by some dirty, half-naked savage, or die of the yellow, or
blue, or black, fever, whichever it is they have over there.
Yes, I must say I do pity Lord Cecil, who never did anything——”</p>

<p>“But transfer his affections to another woman,” murmured
Doris, her face and neck a vivid crimson.</p>

<p>Lady Despard sank back onto the cushions and
laughed with evident enjoyment.</p>

<p>“You little goose, I was leading you on to showing
your hand. And you didn’t see it! Of course, that is
his offense. We could forgive the adventurer-lover who
would have sold us for filthy lucre, and who only repented
and drew back at the last moment; oh, yes, we
can forgive him; but the other—he must be sentenced to
lifelong disappointment, because possibly he was caught,
lured into the net of the cleverest and most unscrupulous
woman in England, and the cleverest and most unscrupulous
man to back her. And we are not proud, we
are not unforgiving! Oh, no, certainly not!” she
summed up, ironically.</p>

<p>Doris screened her face with her hands.</p>

<p>“Why does not he——?” she stopped.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he come forward and beg for forgiveness
and ask you to become his own little Doris again
and Mrs. Marquis?” cried Lady Despard, dryly. “Because
he is as proud as you are, my dear. What! Ask
a girl as rich as a female Crœsus to be his wife when he
has only a few paltry thousands a year; ask the girl who
would scarcely speak a word to him when he came to
wish her good-by, perhaps for the last time. Why, isn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
he a Stoyle, too, and haven’t all of you got, and haven’t
all of you always had, the pride and stiff-neckedness of
the dev—ahem! the evil one? My dear, I am the laziest
soul in London, and I’ve registered a vow that I’ll never
get excited and warm over anything; but really when I
think of you spending your days and nights in hungering
for him——”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Doris, and she glided to her and hid
her face on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“So you do! Do you think I can’t hear you sighing
long after you ought to be asleep, you obstinate and
abandoned girl,” retorted Lady Despard. “Doris, my
dear, if I were only old enough, or you were young
enough, it would be my pleasing duty to shut you up in
your room on bread and water till you came to your
senses and consented to hide your silly little head against
his shirt front, spoiling his clothes instead of mine. My
dear, would you mind covering my dress with your
pocket-handkerchief if you are crying.”</p>

<p>“I’m not crying,” said Doris, indignantly, and giving
her a little push, but still hiding her face. “When—when
did you hear from him last?” she asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Just two months ago,” replied Lady Despard, her
voice growing suddenly serious. “You were too proud
to ask for the news, or I would have told you. He was
well then, but was going up the country after those miserable
Decoys—Dacoits, or whatever they’re called, and
from what I’ve read in the papers I’m afraid——”</p>

<p>Doris’ hand tightened on her shoulder spasmodically.</p>

<p>“Don’t pinch me, my dear. I didn’t send him there.
Catch me! I only wish he’d ask me to be his wife. I’d
have married either of the two men you sent to Jericho;
but that’s the way with the gods, they always shower
their gifts on the unworthy and ungrateful, and deserving
people can go starving.”</p>

<p>“I wish he had,” murmured Doris; “you would both
have been happy then.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t wish anything of the kind,” retorted
Lady Despard, indolently. “You would be ready to tear
my eyes out if there had ever been the slightest chance
of such a thing. Oh, you can’t delude me into thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
you the gentle dove most people imagine you, you little
scorpion.”</p>

<p>“And that is all you know about—about him?” said
Doris, timidly.</p>

<p>“Nearly all. I wish I knew more. I did mention
the matter to his grace at the reception the other night,
and he looked rather grim and solemn, as if the whole
expedition was sentenced——No, no, Doris, I don’t
mean that!” she added, hastily, as Doris’ hand relaxed its
hold, and she drew herself up, white and shuddering.
“No, it ain’t so bad as that; but—but——Well—Ah,
my dear, you ought not to have let him go.”</p>

<p>Doris threw herself down again. “It was not my
fault; if—if he had said—if he had asked——”</p>

<p>“Give me no ifs!” retorted Lady Despard. “My dear
child, no man could have asked you anything while you
treated him as you treated Lord Cecil after the marquis’
death. You were not a live, breathing woman, but a
marble effigy, a block of ice, and you froze him—you
froze him—and sent him to Burmah to thaw himself.
Now, I’m not going to talk any more about him. Get
on your habit, and let us go for a ride. Thank Heaven,
I love no man, and no man loves me! Heigh-ho!”</p>

<p>The footman brought in the evening papers as she
spoke, and she took one and glanced at it languidly;
then suddenly she sat up, and uttered a low cry.</p>

<p>Doris, who had gone to the door, but who had not left
the room, went back to her swiftly.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” she asked.</p>

<p>Lady Despard closed the paper. “I—thought you
had gone,” she said. “Matters?—nothing. The pins
and needles in my feet——”</p>

<p>“There is something in that paper,” said Doris, in her
low voice, her eyes fixed on it. “Tell me what it is!”</p>

<p>Lady Despard hesitated a moment, then she shrugged
her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Well, you’d buy one and see for yourself, so I may
as well show it to you; but—but don’t imagine the worst
at once.”</p>

<p>She handed her the paper, and pointed to a letter from
the seat of war.</p>

<p>In a few—but, alas, how pregnant! words the correspondent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
told the story of the disaster which had befallen
a detachment sent into the interior. Surrounded
and outnumbered by the enemy, savages in nothing
more than their mode of conducting warfare, the handful
of English soldiers had fallen, as so many thousands of
their fellows in the glorious years of the past have done,
fighting to the last. There were only the few details
which can be crammed into a column of newspaper type,
but one line stabbed Doris to the heart.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say that an aide-de-camp, the Marquis of
Stoyle, better known as Lord Cecil, accompanied the
detachment. Throughout the campaign Lord Cecil has
distinguished himself by his bravery and devotion to duty,
and by his genial and modest disposition had won the
hearts of both officers and men. If, as there is too much
reason to fear, his lordship has fallen with his ill-fated
comrades, his loss will be sorely felt, and he can never be
replaced. It will be remembered that he succeeded to the
historic title just twelve months ago, and very shortly before
joining the regiment.”</p>

<p>Doris said not a word, but stood staring at the paper,
with dry eyes, and that awful feeling of benumbing anguish
which crushes pain for a time but to lend it additional
force afterward.</p>

<p>Lady Despard put her arm round her.</p>

<p>“Doris, Doris! my dear, my dear!” she murmured.
“Don’t give way! While there’s life there’s hope; we
can’t tell what may have happened; I have reason to hope,
to think——” She stopped and sprang—actually sprang—to
the door, and throwing it open, said, hurriedly,
“Come in; oh, come in!”</p>

<p>The next moment a tall figure, with a sunburned face
and one arm in a sling, entered, and after a glance, one
anxious glance, at the white face, rushed forward and
caught Doris to him with his sound arm. Lady Despard
waited until this happened, then glided out.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They sat up very late that night, and Lady Despard’s
boudoir was so dimly lighted that as she reclined on her
couch she could not see, or pretended not to see, that
Doris, as she sat at the marquis’ feet, had got his hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
fast locked in hers, almost as if she dreaded lest he
should vanish as suddenly as he had come. And every
now and then she, glancing fearfully at Lady Despard,
laid the brown hand against her cheeks, and near, very
near, to her lips.</p>

<p>There was not much talking, for Lady Despard was
merciful, but at last she looked up.</p>

<p>“And now, my dear Othello, if you can and will deign
to recount some of your adventures, Desdemona and
your humble servant will be gratified. Though I have
known since yesterday that you had escaped, I haven’t
any of the details, and I will confess to a faint and lazy
kind of curiosity. Touching that interesting wound
now, which I do trust will soon be all right, for it must
be so awkward——” she stopped and glanced at Doris,
with provoking archness.</p>

<p>“Yes, tell us!” murmured Doris.</p>

<p>Lord Cecil—he shall be Cecil for us to the end—looked
suddenly grave, and hesitated.</p>

<p>“Yes, I want to tell you, and I must,” he said. “Not
about myself so much as——” He stopped. “Did you
see the list of the killed? Did they give a list of
names?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lady Despard, “it was all surmise. Why
do you ask that?”</p>

<p>“Because——” he stopped again. “Doris,” and he
laid his hand on her head, soothingly, “there was another
person whom you know in this awful business, besides
myself. Cam you guess his name?”</p>

<p>Doris shook her head apprehensively. Lady Despard
leaned forward.</p>

<p>“He was—he became a fast and devoted friend of
mine, Doris. But for him I should not be here, dearest.
He came out with the hospital, and I saw him first
beside my bed. He pulled me through the fever.” He
stopped again, and Doris held her face low down, out of
the lamplight. “We were great friends after that, and
when our detachment was ordered to the interior he volunteered.
I tried to dissuade him. There was no reason
that he should go, but he insisted, and——On the
evening of the fight he stood by the guns with the rest,
and with the rest fought like a lion. Once or twice I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
found a moment to speak to him, for he was always near
me. When the fast struggle came, I joined in the rush—that’s
the only word for it—and saw a couple of the
Dacoits making for me. One I cut down, the other
gave me this,” he pointed to his arm, “and would have
settled me—hush, dearest, don’t cry—but this friend was
near me still, and he threw himself between us.”</p>

<p>He stopped and drew a long breath. “I don’t remember
any more till I came to, and, crawling about, came
upon him. He was alive, just alive, but he knew me. I—I
took his head on my knee, and bent down. Doris,
my darling, Doris, my dearest. Hush, hush! ‘Tell her
that her love saved me from worse than this, Cecil,’ he
said. ‘Tell her that I died with her name on my lips.
Be good to her, Cecil; be good to—Doris!’”</p>

<p>Lady Despard was crying audibly.</p>

<p>“You know, dear, who it was that saved my life,” said
Cecil, in a low voice. “It was Percy Levant.” And he
drew her head upon his breast, and kissed her with protecting
tenderness, as if he were responding to the dead
man’s solemn injunction.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the marquis and marchioness returned from
their long—but for them not too long—honeymoon, society,
deeming it incumbent upon itself to bestow an impressive
welcome on two of its most distinguished members,
gave a ball in honor of the young, and, as the journals
put it, “romantic couple.”</p>

<p>It was a very grand affair, and the <i>Morning Post</i> next
morning devoted a column and a half to its description
and a list of the high and mighty and famous guests, and
stated, rather emphatically, that the most beautiful
woman in the room was the young lady in whose honor
the entertainment was given. It went into newspaper
raptures over her manner, her smile, her dress, and,
lastly, her jewels, which, as it said, consisted of a <i>suite</i>
of magnificent diamonds—the Stoyle diamonds—and
poetically declared that their brilliance was only outshone
by the wearer’s eyes.</p>

<p>They were very beautiful, as a matter of fact, and no
other jewels in the magnificent assemblage could compare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
with them, excepting, perhaps, a <i>suite</i> of pearls set
in antique silver, which was worn by—Lady Grace
Peyton.</p>

<p>Twice in the course of the evening Doris and she met
each other, and on both occasions, while Doris, with
the meekness which, somehow, always distinguishes the
injured innocents, turned her head aside, Lady Grace
stared at her rival with a bold, defiant flash of her handsome
eyes.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Lady Despard, as she stood for a moment
in a corner with Doris, “I think that for cool, unbrazen
impudence, Grace Peyton excels all the world. Most
women, all other women—having done what she has done,
and knowing that we know what she has done—would
have buried themselves in some German watering-place
for the rest of their lives. But, oh no! she not only thinks
fit to put in an appearance here to-night, but actually—actually
flaunts that set of pearls which she got by fraud—stole,
if any one ever stole anything in this world—from
your husband. The whole set!”</p>

<p>“No, not the whole set,” murmured Doris, softly, as she
looked at Lady Grace gliding through a waltz. “I have
the ring.”</p>

<p>“You have! Why, I have never seen it. The ‘ring!’”</p>

<p>“No, you never saw it,” said Doris, a warm flush rising
to her lovely face. “I don’t wear it on my finger, dear,
but—here,” and she touched her heart. “She is welcome
to all the rest while I have that and—him!” she added,
turning to her husband as he came up to them.</p>
